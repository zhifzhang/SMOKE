SMOKE provides two ways of processing mobile sources using MOVES.
(Recall that by "[mobile sources]{.quote}" in SMOKE we mean on-road
mobile sources.) The first approach is to compute mobile emissions
values prior to running SMOKE and provide them to SMOKE as input; we
call this the precomputed-emissions approach. The second approach is to
provide SMOKE with VMT data, Vehicle population (VPOP) data, meteorology
data, and MOVES outputs, and have SMOKE compute the mobile emissions
based on these data; this is called the MOVES approach. These approaches
are not mutually exclusive, so it is possible to provide both
precomputed emissions and VMT and VPOP data to SMOKE and have the system
compute only some of the emissions using MOVES outputs. Both processing
approaches can produce criteria, particulate, and toxics emissions
results.

The precomputed-emissions approach is quite similar to the processing
method for area sources. In fact, [Figure 2.8, "Base case area-source
processing
steps"](ch02s08s02.html#fig_concepts_area_base "Figure 2.8. Base case area-source processing steps"),
[Figure 2.9, "Future- or past-year growth and optional control
area-processing
steps"](ch02s08s02.html#fig_concepts_area_growth "Figure 2.9. Future- or past-year growth and optional control area-processing steps"),
and [Figure 2.10, "Alternative future- or past-year growth and control
area-processing
steps"](ch02s08s02.html#fig_concepts_area_projection "Figure 2.10. Alternative future- or past-year growth and control area-processing steps")
from [Section 2.8.2, "Area-source
processing"](ch02s08s02.html "2.8.2. Area-source processing") show
exactly the processing steps needed for processing mobile sources using
SMOKE and the precomputed-emissions approach. As in base-case processing
for area sources, emissions in the inventory file are subdivided to
hourly emissions during temporal allocation, assigned chemical
speciation factors during speciation, and assigned spatial allocation
factors during gridding. The merge step combines the hourly emissions,
speciation matrix, and gridding matrix to create model-ready emissions.
For future- or past-year processing, the growth and controls step is
added to create the growth and control matrices, while the grow
inventory step converts the inventory from the base year to a future or
past year. The control matrix can be optionally used in the merge step
to apply control factors to the future- or past-year emissions. Note
that, unlike the VMT approach, in the precomputed-emissions approach
SMOKE will not model the variations in emissions caused by temperature,
humidity, or other meteorological settings.

The MOVES approach is much different from the precomputed-emissions
approach. [Figure 2.13, "MOVES mobile RatePerDistance processing
steps"](ch02s08s04.html#fig_concepts_mobile_moves_onroad "Figure 2.13. MOVES mobile RatePerDistance processing steps")
and [Figure 2.14, "MOVES mobile RatePerVehicle and RatPereProfile
(off-network) processing
steps"](ch02s08s04.html#fig_concepts_mobile_moves_offroad "Figure 2.14. MOVES mobile RatePerVehicle and RatPereProfile (off-network) processing steps")
summarize the MOVES approach. First, county total activity inventory VMT
data by road class and vehicle type or county total activity inventory
VPOP by vehicle type are input to SMOKE. The chemical speciation step
computes the chemical speciation factors for each county, road class,
vehicle type, emissions process (e.g., exhaust start, exhaust running,
evaporative processes, extended idle, and crankcase), and pollutant and
stores the necessary factors for this transformation. The gridding step
allocates the sources to grid cells and uses spatial surrogates to
allocate county-total emissions to grid cells, storing the emission
rates needed for these allocations based on hourly gridded ambient
temperature meteorology.

The approach for running MOVES for SMOKE relies on the concept of
representative counties and fuel months. The concept of representative
county refers to running MOVES for a single county, which is the
representative county, to represent itself and other counties that share
the same MOVES input parameters and thus have the same emission rates
for any given speed, temperature and humidity. A reference fuel month
similarly refers to a reference fuel month\'s MOVES run that contains
the temperatures that occur in neighboring months as well as the
representative month. The mapping of calendar months to a representative
month should be assigned on the basis of shared fuel parameters, because
it is the interaction of fuel and temperature that is important. For
example, an average-hourly temperature of 70°F may occur in some hour of
any day in each of four months: May, June, July and August. If those
four months share the same fuel properties (i.e. summer fuel) then an
emission factor will be determined for just the representative month,
reducing by a factor of four the number of calculations that MOVES needs
to perform.

Unlike MOBILE6, MOVES differentiates between on-roadway emission
processes and off-network emission processes. [Figure 2.13, "MOVES
mobile RatePerDistance processing
steps"](ch02s08s04.html#fig_concepts_mobile_moves_onroad "Figure 2.13. MOVES mobile RatePerDistance processing steps")
summarizes the approach used by MOVES for on-roadway mobile sources. The
on-roadway emission process includes county-total VMT and average speed
inventory as input. The off-network emission processes use the
county-total vehicle population by vehicle type as input. [Figure 2.14,
"MOVES mobile RatePerVehicle and RatPereProfile (off-network) processing
steps"](ch02s08s04.html#fig_concepts_mobile_moves_offroad "Figure 2.14. MOVES mobile RatePerVehicle and RatPereProfile (off-network) processing steps")
summarizes the approach used by MOVES for off-network mobile sources.
Both on-roadway and off-network emission processes do require real
gridded meteorology data from MCIP files to estimate
temperature-dependent emission rates.

to mobile sources. These include a special classification of road types
in MOVES, SMOKE and MOVES vehicle types, emissions processes, MOVES
emission factors, representative counties, reference fuel months, and
meteorological processing using **Met4moves**. The following subsections

#### []{#sect_concepts_reference_counties_moves}2.8.4.6. Representative Counties {#representative-counties .title}

</div>

</div>
:::

The approach for running MOVES for SMOKE relies on the concept of
representative counties. These are counties that are used during the
creation and use of emission rates to represent a set of similar
counties (i.e., inventory counties) called a county group. The purpose
of the representative county approach is to reduce the computational
burden of running MOVES on every county in your modeling domain. By
using a represenative county, the user generates key emission rates for
the single county in MOVES and then utilizes these factors to estimate
emissions for all counties in the county group through SMOKE. The
representative county is modeled at a range of speeds and temperatures
to produce emission rate lookup tables (grams/mile or
grams/vehicle/hour, depending on mobile emission process). The variables
that are assumed to be constant across the county group members (and the
representative county) are fuel parameters, fleet age distribution and
inspection/maintenance (I/M) programs. The variables that can vary
within the county group are vehicle miles traveled (VMT), source type
vehicle population, roadway speed, and grid cell temperatures.
Determining the representative counties and their respective county
groups is a key aspect of utilizing the SMOKE-MOVES tool. It is ideal
for the user to create each county group based on the similarity between
the county characteristics (e.g., urban and rural) and the
meteorological conditions (e.g., temperature and relative humidity). The
user should avoid grouping counties that have significantly different
meteorological conditions.

:::

Along with the concept of representative county approach, the concept of
a fuel month is very important. It is used to indicate when a particular
set of fuel properties should be used in a MOVES simulation. Similar to
the representative county, the fuel month reduces the computational time
of MOVES by using a single month to represent a set of months. To
determine the fuel month and which months it corresponds to, the user
should review the State-provided fuel supply data in the MOVES database
for each representative county. If the fuel supply data change
throughout the year, then group the months by fuel parameters. For
example, if the grams/mile exhaust emission rates in January are
identical to February\'s rates for a given representative county, then
use a single fuel month to represent January and February. In other
words, only one of the months needs to be modeled through MOVES.

The meteorological data processor program **Met4moves** prepares
spatially and temporally averaged temperatures and relative humidity
data to set up the meteorological input conditions for MOVES and SMOKE
using the Meteorology-Chemistry Interface Processor (MCIP) output files.

[**Met4moves**](ch06s07.html "6.7. Met4moves") must be run after MCIP
and before the MOVES Driver script **"[Runspec\_generator.pl]{.quote}"**
and SMOKE modeling system.

The following are the major processing steps that **Met4moves**
performs:

::: {.itemizedlist}
-   Read the representative county cross-reference file
    [`MCXREF`{.envar}](ch08s09s02.html#sect_input_mcxref "8.9.2.1.3. MCXREF: Mobile representative county cross-reference file")
    that contains a list of representative counties and the county
    groups that map to those representative counties.

-   Read the surrogate description file
    [`SRGDESC`{.envar}](ch08s04.html#sect_input_srgdesc "8.4.1. SRGDESC: Surrogate Designation, Description and Surrogate profile filename.")
    and a list of associated spatial surrogate(s) chosen for use in
    selecting grid cells.

-   Determine a list of grid cells for each county. Only the selected
    grid cells are used to estimate the min/max temperatures, 24-hour
    temperature profiles, and RH over the user-specified modeling
    period.

-   Set the dates of the modeling episode in local time using the flags
    `STDATE`{.envar} and `ENDATE`{.envar}

-   Determine the fuel month for the representative county using the
    [`MFMREF`{.envar}](ch08s09s02.html#sect_input_mfmref "8.9.2.1.5. MFMREF: Mobile fuel month file for MOVES")
    input file.

-   Read the country/state/county
    [`COSTCY`{.envar}](ch08s10s02.html "8.10.2. COSTCY: Country, state, and county names and data")
    or
    [`GEOCODE_LEVEL[1-4]`{.envar}](ch08s10s03.html "8.10.3. GEOCODE_LEVEL[1-4]: Geographical Input Files")
    (if USE\_EXP\_GEOCODES Y) file to define the time zones for county
    groups.

-   Read the meteorology data that have been processed by MCIP.

-   Calculate the min/max temperatures hourly and over the modeling
    period.

-   Calculate average RH for the specified hour range over the modeling
    period.

-   Once min/max temperatures and averaged RH are estimated for all
    representative counties and all inventory counties in the county
    groups, estimate diurnal 24-hour temperature profiles for use by the
    MOVES Driver script. The result is a normalized 24-hour shape
    profile over the user-specified period or fuel month.

When the MOVES model runs for SMOKE, it runs for all emissions processes
(or modes), including on-roadway and off-network emissions processes,
for the selected pollutants. Off-network emission processes (e.g.,
parked engine-off, engine starts, and idling, and fuel vapor venting) in
MOVES are hour-dependent due to vehicle activity assumptions built into
the MOVES model; the emission rate depends on both hour of the day and
temperature. On-roadway emission processes (e.g., running exhaust,
crankcase running exhaust, brake wear, tire wear, and on-road
evaporative), on the other hand, do not depend on hour. In MOVES, these
emission processes are categorized into three major groups:

::: {.itemizedlist}
-   [**RatePerDistance (RPD) -** ]{.bold}The emission rate of on-roadway
    vehicles (i.e., driving) from MOVES. The rate is expressed in
    grams/mile traveled.
-   [**RatePerVehicle (RPV) -** ]{.bold}The emission rate of vehicles
    off-network (e.g., idling, starts, refueling, parked) from MOVES.
    The rate is given in grams/vehicle/hour.
-   [**RatePerProfile (RPP) -** ]{.bold}The emission rate of vehicles
    off-network specifically, the evaporation from parked vehicles
    (vapor-venting emissions) from MOVES. The rate is expressed in
    grams/vehicle/hour.
-   [**RatePerHour (RPH) -** ]{.bold}The emission rate of extended idle
    exhaust from on-roadway vehicle. The rate is expressed in grams/hour
    traveled.
:::

MOVES emission rates are organized into four lookup tables (RPD, RPV,
RPP, RPH), depending on emission process and whether the vehicle is
parked or in motion. The approach to running MOVES for SMOKE is unique
for each emission rate table listed in [Table 2.6, "MOVES Emission
Processes by Emission Rate
Tables"](ch02s08s04.html#tbl_concepts_moves_emission_rate_tbl "Table 2.6. MOVES Emission Processes by Emission Rate Tables").
A complete inventory must use the emission rates from all three tables.
Note that refueling emission process is not a subject to MOVES emission
rate table approach yet.

[*The RPD lookup table*]{.emphasis} is used to provide estimates of
on-roadway emissions processes from mobile sources, using a separate
file for each representative county. The on-road running processes that
appear in this table include running exhaust, crankcase running exhaust,
brake wear, tire wear, on-road evaporative permeation, on-road
evaporative fuel leaks, and on-road evaporative vapor venting. The units
of the emission rates in this table are grams/mile. The lookup fields
for the factors are temperature and average speed. There are 16 set
speed bins defined in [Table 2.7, "MOVES Default Speed
Bins"](ch02s08s04.html#tbl_moves_speed_bins "Table 2.7. MOVES Default Speed Bins")
(i.e., avgSpeedBinID 1=2.5mph, 2=5mph, 3=10mph, ...16=75mph). The
avgBinSpeed is used for interpolation in the RPD table.

[*The RPV lookup table*]{.emphasis} is used to provide estimates of
off-network emission processes (parked engine-off, engine starts, and
idling), except for the evaporative off-network vapor venting emissions
process. A separate file is provided for each representative county. The
off-network emission processes include start exhaust, crankcase start
exhaust, off-network evaporative permeation, off-network evaporative
fuel leaks, extended idle exhaust, and crankcase extended idle exhaust.
Fuel month, temperature, and local hour are the lookup fields in this
table, and hours are in the local time of the modeling county. The units
of the emission rates are grams/vehicle/hour. Note: Although the units
are grams/vehicle/hour, the number of vehicles (i.e., population) should
not be temporally allocated to hours in SMOKE. Instead, a county total
of vehicle population should be multiplied by emission rates at any
given hour. The number of starts per vehicle by hour is already
accounted for in the MOVES lookup table.

[*The RPP table*]{.emphasis} is used only to estimate emissions for
off-network fuel vapor venting when the vehicle is parked. This process
type includes diurnal (when the vehicle is parked during the day) and
hot soak (immediately after a trip when the vehicle parks) emissions
types. The process depends on the rate of rise in temperature and the
maximum temperature achieved during the day for the diurnal emissions
type, and on the hourly temperatures for the hot soak emission type. The
lookup fields for this table are reference fuel month and hour of day.
As with the RPV table, the units of the emission rates are
grams/vehicle/hour. The estimated emissions rates need to be multiplied
by the county vehicle population. The representative county lookup
tables contain 24-hour emission rates per hour per vehicle using a
representative county temperature profile with different minimum and
maximum temperatures. The average day county emissions are determined by
interpolating between the minimum and maximum temperatures for the
modeling county generated by **Met4moves**. [Section 2.8.4.8,
"Meteorological Data
Processing"](ch02s08s04.html#sect_concepts_moves_met_processing "2.8.4.8. Meteorological Data Processing")
summarizes how **Met4moves** processes meteorological data for both
MOVES and SMOKE.

[*The RPH table*]{.emphasis} is used only to estimate emissions for
on-roadway extended idle exhaust process from mobile sources, using a
separate file for each representative county.

The following [Table 2.8, "MOVES Pollutant
Groups"](ch02s08s04.html#tbl_concepts_moves_pollutant_groups "Table 2.8. MOVES Pollutant Groups")
provides a list of available MOVES pollutant groups that the user can
specify to model within MOVES. The choice of pollutant groups(s)
determines what pollutants are included in the three emission rate
lookup tables (RPD, RPV, and RPP) output by MOVES. The letter \'X\'
marks the key pollutants for inclusion, and a letter \'d\' signifies
that the pollutant is included as a default in the MOVES run because a
key pollutant depends on it. The user modifies the
[control.in](ch08s09s02.html#sect_input_runctlfile "8.9.2.2.1. Run Control File for MOVES Driver Script")
input file to specify the pollutant group.
