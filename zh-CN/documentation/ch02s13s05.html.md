:::

After applying the growth factors to the SMOKE intermediate inventory
file, the **Grwinven** program writes a new SMOKE intermediate inventory
file that contains the new, grown emissions. **Grwinven** only writes
the I/O API part of the inventory and not the ASCII part, because the
ASCII part that contains the state/county codes, SCCs, and other
character strings does not change between the base and future or past
year. All of the sources in the base and grown inventory files are the
same; the difference is in their emissions values.

**Grwinven** adds a header element to the I/O API part of the inventory
file that indicates the file was created using **Grwinven** and a growth
matrix. The header element is /FYEAR/, which is followed by the date of
the future year (for example, /FYEAR/ 2018). Other programs (such as
**Temporal**) will recognize the /FYEAR/ header element and alter its
messages to indicate that a future year is being processed.
