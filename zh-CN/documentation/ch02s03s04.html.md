SMOKE uses a 6-digit integer code to identify a country, state (or
province), and county (or other region) for a particular source. Most
U.S. inventories input to SMOKE have the 5-digit U.S. Federal
Implementation Planning Standards (FIPS) state and county codes. All
inventory input formats have been adapted to include a special header
record with which you can specify the country, effectively allowing the
inventories to be provided with the 6-digit code that SMOKE uses. The
6-digit system was designed for use in the United States with states and
counties, as well as Canada and Mexico, but it can be adapted for other
uses. The format used by SMOKE for the codes is:

::: {.informalfigure}
::: {.mediaobject}

The SMOKE installation is set up to use U.S.-centered codes as defined
in the `COSTCY`{.envar} or the `GEOCODE_LEVEL4`{.envar} (if
USE\_EXP\_GEOCODES Y) file, which contains the codes and their
associated names and time zone settings. In this file, the U.S. country
code is zero, which allows the U.S. country/state/county codes to be the
same as the FIPS state/county codes that appear in U.S. inventories. See
[Section 8.10.2, "`COSTCY`{.envar}: Country, state, and county names and
data"](ch08s10s02.html "8.10.2. COSTCY: Country, state, and county names and data")
for more information on the `COSTCY`{.envar} file format.

To change the meaning of the country, state, or county codes in SMOKE,
the `COSTCY`{.envar} or the `GEOCODE_LEVEL4`{.envar} (if
USE\_EXP\_GEOCODES Y) file must be modified to use different names
associated with each country, state, county or tribal number. All SMOKE
input files must also use this new numbering scheme, including inventory
files and cross-reference files.

Acceptable values in SMOKE for the country code are 0 through 9.
Acceptable values of the state code are 1 through 99. Acceptable values
of the county code are 1 through 999. No alphabetic codes are accepted,
since SMOKE stores these values as integers.
