Many of the support files used in the test cases are based on the EPA's
NEI modeling platform, available online at EPA's Emission Modeling
Clearinghouse
([http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/](http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/emch/index.html)).

The nctox case provides users with an example of using both criteria and
toxics emissions inventories. The purposes of this case include:

::: {.itemizedlist}
-   Providing a test case for SMOKE on users computers. It is not
    recommended for actual user\'s emissions modeling work.

-   Provide example scripts that users may adapt to their own cases
:::

This case has the following major features. It runs for July 10th and
11th, 2005 on a 12-km Lambert Conformal grid over North Carolina. The
spatial extent of this case has been limited to provide a relatively
fast test case, and the domain is a subdomain of EPA's 12-km national
grid. The case includes toxics processing for stationary area, nonroad
mobile, and point sources.

At this time, the case uses North Carolina records [*only*]{.emphasis}
from the following inventory data:

[**stationary area sources:**]{.bold} 2005 NEI for CO, NO~x~, VOC,
SO~2~, NH~3~, PM~10~, and PM~2.5~ from nonpt, averfire and alm sectors

[**nonroad mobile sources:**]{.bold} 2005 NEI for CO, NO~x~, VOC, SO~2~,
NH~3~, PM~10~, and PM~2.5~ from nonroad sector

[**point sources:**]{.bold} 2005 NEI for CO, NO~x~, VOC, SO~2~, NH~3~,
PM~10~, and PM~2.5~ from ptipm and ptnonipm sectors

[**mobile sources:**]{.bold} vehicle mileage traveled (VMT) and its
average speed (SPEED), and vehicle average hotteling (HOTELLING) for
onroad mobile sources, and vehicle population (VPOP) for offroad mobile
sources

[**biogenic sources:**]{.bold} BELD3 data processed using BEIS3 (for
entire grid, even those cells that are not in North Carolina)

For area, mobile, and point sources, this case uses toxics inventories
for ozone modeling. The VOC model species for the current CB6 mechanism
are based in part on the toxic inventory. SMOKE resolves the duplicate
VOC mass caused by combining VOC emissions with toxic VOC emissions by
subtracting the toxic VOC mass from the VOC mass and computing a
NONHAPVOC emissions value. This is the "[integrate]{.quote}" approach
for VOC emissions, described in [Section 2.9.5, "Combine toxics and
criteria
inventories"](ch02s09s05.html "2.9.5. Combine toxics and criteria inventories").
The speciation profiles provided with this version of SMOKE include
profiles that map the toxics VOC and NONHAPVOC pollutants to current CB6
species. Choices for speciation profiles in this version of SMOKE are
listed in [Section 4.4.10, "Use a different speciation mechanism or
change speciation
inputs"](ch04s04s10.html "4.4.10. Use a different speciation mechanism or change speciation inputs").

In addition to the inventory data listed above, the parameters of the
case are the following:

::: {.itemizedlist}
-   [**Episode:**]{.bold} July 10th and 11th of 2005

-   [**Output time zone:**]{.bold} Greenwich Mean Time (zone 0)

-   [**Projection:**]{.bold} Lambert Conformal with Alpha=33, Beta=45,
    Gamma=-97, and center at (-97,40)

-   [**Domain:**]{.bold} Origin at (1128, -672) kilometers with 66
    columns by 52 rows and 12-km square grid cells (shown in
    [Figure 4.1, "nctox
    domain"](ch04s02.html#fig_scripts_nctox_domain "Figure 4.1. nctox domain"))

-   [**Meteorology data:**]{.bold} Daily (25-hour) 2005 meteorology
    files generated originally by EPA using MM5 and MCIP; the files have
    been reduced to the modeling domain and contain only the variables
    needed by SMOKE.

-   [**Chemical speciation data:**]{.bold} Revised `GSPRO`{.envar} and
    `GSREF`{.envar} files to include toxic pollutants mapped to
    current-CB6 mechanism for both on-road and nonroad mobile source
    classification category (SCC) codes.
