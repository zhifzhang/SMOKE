In addition to actually applying the growth factors, the growth
processing reports the factors that were applied to each source.
**Cntlmat** writes a report that includes the source characteristics and
the factor from the /PROJECTION/ packet assigned to the source. For
example, the area-source report would include the state, county, and
SCCs along with the factor assigned to the source. Only those sources
that have growth factors applied are included in the report. This report
permits you to verify that the assignments you intended were in fact
made by the program. The report is called the `APROJREP`{.envar},
`MPROJREP`{.envar}, or `PPROJREP`{.envar} file for SMOKE area, mobile,
and point sources, respectively.
