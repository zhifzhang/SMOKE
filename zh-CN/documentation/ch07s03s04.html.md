The /DELIMITER/ packet can be used to change the column delimiter used
in the output reports from **Smkreport**. The default delimiter is a
semicolon (;). You can change the delimiter to any single-character
value to suit your needs, although using a space as a delimiter may
result in slightly misformatted reports. Some reasons to change the
delimiter from the default are:

::: {.itemizedlist}
-   You are reporting "[BY SOURCE]{.quote}" and including the source
    name, and it has semicolons included in one or more of the names.
    This would prevent those records in the output report from being
    read into another program using semicolon as the delimeter.

-   Software you want to use to read the **Smkreport** output report
    does not support semi-colons for delimiters.

-   You prefer a different appearance in the reports; you can select
    another delimiter that does not conflict with other fields in your
    report.
:::

The syntax of this instruction is the following:

/DELIMITER/ ,

This example results in a comma (,) being used as the delimiter for
columns of any results from /CREATE REPORT/ instructions that followed
this instruction in the `REPCONFIG`{.envar} file.
