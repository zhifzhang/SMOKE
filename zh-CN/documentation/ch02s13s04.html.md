:::

The **Grwinven** program applies the growth factors to the inventory
pollutants by simply multiplying the growth matrices for the pollutants
with the annual and average-day emission values. It reads in the SMOKE
intermediate inventory file and up to 80 growth matrices, then applies
the growth factors from all growth matrices to the appropriate
pollutants. If a growth matrix has the "[pfac]{.quote}" variable,
**Grwinven** applies the factors to all pollutants in the inventory; if
instead the matrix has pollutant-specific entries, the factors are
applied by matching the pollutants between the matrix and the inventory.

As is further described in [Section 2.14, "Control
processing"](ch02s14.html "2.14. Control processing"), **Grwinven** can
also apply the control matrix at the same time it applies the growth
matrix, and the total number of growth and control matrices that can be
applied in one run is 80. The **Grwinven** program's growth processing
features cannot be applied to a SMOKE intermediate file that
**Grwinven** has created, because of the /FYEAR/ header element
described in the next section.
