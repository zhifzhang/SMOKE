[*Processing categories:*]{.emphasis} mobile

**Movesmrg** is a mobile-sources-only program, loosely based on the
SMOKE program **Smkmerge**, that combines the intermediate files
produced by the other SMOKE programs (i.e., **SmkInven**, **Grdmat**,
**Spcmat**, **Temporal**). The **movesmrg** program is discussed in
detail in [Section 6.8, "**Movesmrg**"](ch06s08.html "6.8. Movesmrg").
Similar to [**Smkmerge**](ch06s14.html "6.14. Smkmerge"), the main goal
of [**Movesmrg**](ch06s08.html "6.8. Movesmrg") is to create (1)
gridded, speciated, hourly air quality model-ready input files and (2)
county-level SCC summaries. The primary difference between **Movesmrg**
and **Smkmerge** is that **Movesmrg** uses the SMOKE Formatted MOVES
emission rate lookup tables to compute emissions on the fly, by
multiplying the emissions factors by hourly VMT (for RatePerDistance
\[RPD\]), annual or monthly hotelling hours (for RatePerHour \[RPH\]) or
by monthly or annual vehicle populations (for RatePerVehicle \[RPV\] or
RatePerProfile \[RPP\]).

**Movesmrg** must be run four times to compute on-roadway and
off-network (including vapor venting) emissions processes individually,
since the emission rate calculation methods in SMOKE for these
categories are quite different. Once all three emissions processes have
been computed, the emission output files can be merged (optionally along
with other 2D sectors separate from onroad) using **Mrggrid**, which
combines any number of 2D or 3D hourly, gridded, and speciated emission
data files. See the section [Section 6.10,
"**Mrggrid**"](ch06s10.html "6.10. Mrggrid") for more details on the
above programs.

::: {.itemizedlist}
-   [**RPD, RPH and RPV Emission Calculations**]{.bold}

    For its RPD, RPH and RPV lookup table calculations, **Movesmrg**
    uses the gridded hourly temperatures in GMT, and then adjusts the
    hour of the RPD, RPH and RPV lookup tables from local time to GMT to
    get the emission rates for the representative county for the
    appropriate month. The key lookup fields for the factors are hourly
    temperature and avarage speed for the RPD lookup table calculation,
    hourly temperature for the RPH lookup table calculation, and hourly
    temperature and hour of the day in local time for the RPV table
    calculation.

-   [**RPP Emission Calculations**]{.bold}

    For the RPP lookup table calculations, **Movesmrg** uses the RPP
    lookup table as an input file for the emission rates that depend not
    on the gridded hourly temperatures, but on the temperature profiles
    output by the **Met4moves** program. The emissions estimates based
    on the RPP table are computed for the temporal averaging period
    specified for the temperature profiles, rather than using hourly
    gridded meteorology.
