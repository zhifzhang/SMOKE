The **Smkmerge** program is a second option for applying control
matrices. **Smkmerge** can apply both multiplicative control matrices
and reactivity control matrices; it is the only program that can do the
latter. Because the overall purpose of **Smkmerge** is to create the
model-ready input files for an AQM (as discussed in [Section 2.18,
"Creating model-ready
emissions"](ch02s18.html "2.18. Creating model-ready emissions"), the
result of using **Smkmerge** to apply control matrices is a controlled,
model-ready file, as opposed to the controlled intermediate inventory
file output by **Grwinven**.

**Smkmerge** is limited to applying one control matrix and one
reactivity matrix for each SMOKE source category (area, mobile, or
point). Therefore, if multiple reactivity control matrices need to be
applied to create a single set of model-ready emission inputs, then the
processing must be done as multiple SMOKE runs. This includes separating
the sources that need different controls into separate inventory files
and performing all SMOKE processing steps separately on the runs, using
different reactivity controls for each. The resulting two or more sets
of model-ready emissions should not have duplicate sources if the
inventories were separated correctly at the start, and the model-ready
files are combined using the **Mrggrid** program, as discussed in
[Section 2.18, "Creating model-ready
emissions"](ch02s18.html "2.18. Creating model-ready emissions").
