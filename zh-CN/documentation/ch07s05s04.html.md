This section provides some ideas on things to check after SMOKE has been
run to a successful completion (and after the other QA steps described
above have been completed). The review steps listed here will help
ensure that SMOKE is working properly. However, these recommendations
will not enable you to identify any missing sources (the source exists
but was not included in the inventory) or wrong emissions sources (the
source is in the inventory, but the emissions are completely incorrect),
so it is up to you to understand your emission inventory and make sure
that it is representative of the emissions for the regions and years of
interest.

The following checks should be performed to ensure that the area-source
and nonroad mobile-source processing was done properly:

::: {.orderedlist}
1.  Compare state and/or county totals among the following processing
    steps:

    ::: {.orderedlist}
    a.  Inventory import

    b.  Spatial allocation

    c.  Temporal allocation for key days (e.g., weekday, Saturday, and
        Sunday)

    d.  Chemical speciation (e.g., add up NO/NO~2~ and VOC species using
        the SELECT DATA instruction in **Smkreport** with the S- prefix)

    e.  Final merge

    f.  Make comparisons for multiple grid resolutions, if applicable.
    :::

    The differences and similarities revealed at each stage should be
    these:

    ::: {.orderedlist}
    a.  Import totals (after **Smkinven** processing) should be the same
        as inventory totals outside of SMOKE (if available).

    b.  Spatial allocation totals should be the same as the import
        totals for all states/counties except those on a grid boundary.
        Comparing totals after spatial allocation among multiple grids
        should reveal that the emissions totals are the same in all
        grids for states/counties that are completely within the grids.

    c.  Temporal allocation should be different for weekdays, Saturday,
        and Sunday, and different from the average-weekday or average
        annual value represented by the import totals. The differences
        should be in the correct direction: generally, area sources are
        higher on weekends because of lawn/garden emissions. If you are
        using an average-day inventory (not an annual inventory),
        confirm that monthly adjustments have not been made. Check that
        any holiday days have been processed as directed based on the
        `HOLIDAYS`{.envar} files (e.g., that weekday holidays have been
        processed as Sundays).

    d.  Chemical speciation should match total mass before and after
        (again, the **Smkreport** SELECT DATA option with the S- prefix
        is helpful here).

    e.  Final merged files should match between the **Smkmerge** and
        **Smkreport** reports.
    :::

2.  Create report of temporal allocation factors used, by SCC. Review
    profiles assigned to SCCs representing the top 50%-80% of key
    area/nonroad pollutants for your inventory.

3.  Create report of spatial surrogates used, by SCC. Review spatial
    surrogates assigned to SCCs representing the top 50%-80% of key
    area/nonroad pollutants for your inventory.

4.  Create report of speciation profiles used, by SCC. Review speciation
    profiles assigned to SCCs representing the top 50%-80% of key
    area/nonroad pollutants for your inventory.

5.  Create reports by state/SCC for key states in your domain (the
    SELECT REGION statement in **Smkreport** can be used to isolate
    certain states for this report). Review these reports to ensure that
    the totals are consistent with expectations. Compare and contrast
    emissions by SCC among states. Include per-capita reports as well as
    total emissions reports, and review these to determine if per-capita
    emissions differences make sense from state to state; this approach
    can often identify outliers in inventories (caused by improper
    units, double counting, or out-of-date inventory creation approach).

6.  Create spatial plots (e.g., using VERDI) of average-day emissions
    for each day (these daily-total emissions can be created by running
    **Smkmerge** with `MRG_TEMPORAL`{.envar} set to N). Daily-total
    plots can also be created from the model-ready plots using the I/O
    API utility **m3tproc**. Do for all grids (if applicable) and
    compare.

7.  Create temporal profile plots (e.g., using VERDI) of hourly, gridded
    data over the entire episode. Look for consistent patterns on
    consistent days (e.g., all non-holiday weekdays in a single month
    should have the same value). Do for all grids (if applicable) and
    compare. Check for holidays and ensure these were processed as
    Sundays.

The following checks should be performed to ensure that the
point-sources processing was done properly:

::: {.orderedlist}
1.  Compare state and/or county totals at the following processing steps
    for all grids:

    ::: {.orderedlist}
    a.  Inventory import

    b.  Spatial allocation

    c.  Temporal allocation for weekday, Saturday, and Sunday

        the SELECT DATA instruction in **Smkreport** with the S- prefix)

    e.  Layer fractions

    f.  Final merge
    :::

    The differences and similarities revealed at each stage should be
    these:

    ::: {.orderedlist}
    a.  Import totals (after **Smkinven** processing) should be the same
        as inventory totals outside of SMOKE (if available)

    b.  Spatial allocation should be the same as the import totals for
        all states/counties except those on a grid boundary. Comparing
        totals after spatial allocation among multiple grids should
        reveal that the emissions totals are the same in all grids for
        states/counties that are completely within the grids.

    c.  Temporal allocation may or may not be different for weekdays,
        Saturday, and Sunday, and different from the average-weekday or
        average annual value represented by the import totals. The
        differences should be in the correct direction: generally, many
        of the electric generating facilities (major emissions sources)
        are the same for all days of the week because the power plants
        never shut down and their emissions do not depend much on the
        day of the week. Emissions for major manufacturing plants will
        often be closed completely on weekends and have no emissions. If
        using an average-day inventory (not an annual inventory),
        confirm that monthly adjustments have not been made. Check that
        any holiday days have been processed as directed based on the
        `HOLIDAYS`{.envar} files (e.g., that weekday holidays have been
        processed as Sundays).

        If using day-specific or hour-specific inventory data, then it
        will be harder to compare the inventory totals before input to
        SMOKE to the emissions totals after temporal processing. This is
        because part of a state/county total when using hour-day- or
        hour-specific data include these data and part do not, but the
        inventory totals are often available only for the annual and/or
        average-day emissions values. This limitation can be rectified
        by calculating the emissions totals for the day- and
        hour-specific data outside of SMOKE, and analyzing these sources
        by SCC instead of only by state/county to separate the analysis
        of the annual and/or average-day emissions from the analysis of
        the day- and/or hour-specific emissions.

    d.  Chemical speciation should match total mass before and after
        (again, the **Smkreport** SELECT DATA option with the S- prefix
        is helpful here).

    e.  Emissions totals should match before and after layer fractions
        for all grids. Note that the layer fractions will be different
        across grids for sources that are in multiple grids because the
        meteorology data are different.

    f.  Final merged files should match between the **Smkmerge** and
        **Smkreport** reports.
    :::

2.  Create report of temporal allocation factors used, by SCC. Review
    profiles assigned to SCCs representing the top 50%-80% of key
    point-source pollutants for your inventory.

3.  Create report of speciation profiles used, by SCC. Review speciation
    profiles assigned to SCCs representing the top 50%-80% of key
    point-source pollutants for your inventory.

4.  Create reports by state/plant for key states. These should include
    the grid cell in which the plant is located, which should be
    reviewed for correctness. A GIS analysis approach could be helpful
    for this step, to match the grid cells in the report with an
    independent assessment of the state/county. Major sources should be
    reviewed for correct emissions and correct locations.

5.  Create reports with layer fractions for all major power plants in
    key states. Include grid cell in which the plant is located. Perform
    a reality-check on the plume rise; large power plants should have
    high plume rise, but the plumes should still be well distributed
    throughout the model layers.

6.  Create the spatial and temporal profile plots discussed in items 6
    and 7 above for area/nonroad processing, except for the spatial
    plots you need to first condense the I/O API model-ready files to
    2-D instead of 3-D files. The I/O API utility **vertot** can be used
    to sum layers from 3-D files to 2-D files.

    for all grids (if applicable):

    ::: {.orderedlist}
    a.  Inventory import (VMT only)

    c.  Compare emissions among all days by states. Compare sample
        weekday emissions daily-totals with average-day VMT to see if
        sources with high VMT have high emissions. Calculate ratios
        between VMT and emissions and look for outliers.

    d.  Compare temporalized daily-totals with speciation/temporalized
        daily-totals of mass emissions

    e.  Final merge

    c.  Temporal allocation should be different for weekdays, Saturday,
        and Sunday (note: no average-day values are available for
        on-road mobile-source processing using MOBILE6). The differences
        should be in the correct direction: generally, mobile sources
        are lower on weekends. Check any holidays to ensure that Sunday
        emissions were used.

    d.  Chemical speciation should match total mass before and after
        (the SELECT DATA statement in **Smkreport** with the S- prefix
        can be helpful here).

    e.  Final merged files emissions totals from **Smkmerge** should
        match the temporal/speciated emissions reports from
        **Smkreport**.
