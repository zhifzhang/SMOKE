**Smkinven** imports all data and then sets the inventory base year in
the file as the year that has the most data values. The year of the
inventories is set using the \#YEAR header for ORL and FF10 inputs, (see
[Section 8.2, "Inventory Files"](ch08s02.html "8.2. Inventory Files")
for more information on this header and packet). Usually, the year of
the data is the same for all sources, so you will know what **Smkinven**
will assume is the base year. However, if multiple inventory years are
provided, **Smkinven** will set it using the year that is associated
with the largest number of sources.

If you provide a future-year inventory to SMOKE, you must override the
base-year setting obtained from the values given by the \#YEAR header or
the /INVYEAR/ packet. This is accomplished with the
`SMK_BASEYR_OVERRIDE`{.envar} setting. This is necessary so that later
SMOKE steps will be able to verify that the episode year is consistent
with the base year.
