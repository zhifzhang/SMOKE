</div>

:::

The **Grwinven** program applies the multiplicative control matrices to
the inventory pollutants by multiplying the control factors for the
pollutants with the annual and average-day emission values. (Reactivity
matrices cannot be applied by **Grwinven**; only the **Smkmerge**
program can apply those, as discussed in [Section 2.14.7, "Using
**Smkmerge** to apply the multiplicative and/or reactivity control
matrices"](ch02s14s07.html "2.14.7. Using Smkmerge to apply the multiplicative and/or reactivity control matrices").)
**Grwinven** reads in the SMOKE intermediate inventory file and up to 80
control matrices and then applies the control factors from all matrices
to the appropriate pollutants.

As discussed in [Section 2.13.4, "Applying the growth
matrix"](ch02s13s04.html "2.13.4. Applying the growth matrix"), the
**Grwinven** program can also apply growth matrices at the same time it
applies control matrices, and the total number of growth and control
matrices that can be applied in one run is 80. If desired, the control
processing features of **Grwinven** can be used on a SMOKE intermediate
file that has been created by **Grwinven** with grown and/or controlled
emissions, as long as no [*growth*]{.emphasis} processing features are
included in that second pass. (See section [Section 2.13.4, "Applying
the growth
matrix"](ch02s13s04.html "2.13.4. Applying the growth matrix") for
discussion of this restriction on applying growth matrices, caused by
**Grwinven**'s addition of the /FYEAR/ header element.)
