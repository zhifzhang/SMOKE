The **Smkinven** program is responsible for importing the raw inventory
into SMOKE format. **Smkinven** creates the following output files:

::: {.itemizedlist}
-   Inventory import report: [Section 10.5.1,
    "`REPINVEN`{.envar}"](ch10s05.html#sect_output_repinven "10.5.1. REPINVEN")

-   SCC file: [Section 10.5.2, "`ASCC`{.envar}, `MSCC`{.envar},
    `PSCC`{.envar}"](ch10s05s02.html "10.5.2. ASCC, MSCC, PSCC")

Summary: This report is made up of several different sections describing
different parts of the inventory import.

::: {.orderedlist}
1.  This section lists, by CAS number, the emissions in tons/year; the
    number of inventory records; whether all, some, or none of the
    pollutants associated with that CAS number were kept; and the CAS
    number description.

    The columns in the report include:

    ::: {.itemizedlist}
    -   CAS number

    -   Whether all, some, or none of the pollutants were kept

    -   Number of inventory records read for the CAS number

    -   Emissions for the CAS number

    -   CAS number description
    :::

2.  This section includes emissions before and after application of
    disaggregation factors from the `INVTABLE`{.envar}. Only the
    pollutants that have Keep = Y in `INVTABLE`{.envar} will be included
    in this report. This report will be provided only if disaggregation
    and/or aggregation have occurred.

    The columns in the report include:

    ::: {.itemizedlist}
    -   "[Kept]{.quote}" unique CAS number

    -   Emissions total for the CAS number

    -   Factor used to adjust the CAS number to the pollutant

    -   Pollutant name

    -   Emissions total of the inventory pollutant

    -   Pollutant description

    -   CAS number description
    :::
:::

The following sections are only for area-to-point assignments:

::: {.orderedlist}
3.  This section lists SCCs that have area-to-point source factor file
    assignments but are not in the inventory.

    The columns in the report include:

    ::: {.itemizedlist}
    -   Assigned SCC codes not in the inventory
    :::

4.  For emissions going to point sources, this section lists the
    pollutant name, emissions total before and after the factors are
    applied, and the total number of FIPS codes affected, by SCC.

    The columns in the report include:

    ::: {.itemizedlist}
    -   SCC code

    -   Pollutant name

    -   Number of FIPS codes affected

    -   Emissions before factors are applied

    -   Emissions after factors are applied

    -   SCC description
    :::

5.  Same as the above section, except emissions are reported by state.

    The columns in the report include:

    ::: {.itemizedlist}
    -   State

    -   SCC code

    -   Pollutant name

    -   Number of FIPS codes affected

    -   Emissions before factors are applied

    -   Emissions after factors are applied

    -   SCC description
    :::

6.  This section lists, by SCC, the number of state and county FIPS
    codes getting assigned to point locations and the number not getting
    assigned.

    The columns in the report include:

    ::: {.itemizedlist}
    -   SCC code

    -   Number of FIPS assigned to point locations

    -   Number of FIPS not assigned to point locations

    -   SCC description
