configuration"](ch03s02s04.html#fig_dirs_files_base "Figure 3.4. Locations of intermediate and output files for SMOKE base case, basic configuration"),

future-/past-year
case"](ch03s02s04.html#fig_dirs_files_growth "Figure 3.6. Locations of intermediate and output files for SMOKE future-/past-year case")
show the locations of the output files as well as the intermediate
files. The output files go to the subdirectory of the
`data/run_$ESCEN`{.filename} directory called `output`{.filename}. This
output directory has two subdirectories: the first is set by the
`$SPC`{.envar} environment variable from the Assigns file that sets the
model and chemical mechanism being used for a SMOKE run; the second is
named `merge`{.filename}. There can be just one set of these
subdirectories (as in the basic configuration shown in [Figure 3.4,
"Locations of intermediate and output files for SMOKE base case, basic
configuration"](ch03s02s04.html#fig_dirs_files_base "Figure 3.4. Locations of intermediate and output files for SMOKE base case, basic configuration"))
or multiple sets (as in the advanced configuration shown in [Figure 3.5,
"Locations of intermediate and output files for SMOKE base case,
advanced
configuration"](ch03s02s04.html#fig_dirs_files_advanced "Figure 3.5. Locations of intermediate and output files for SMOKE base case, advanced configuration")).

The `$SPC`{.envar} subdirectory contains the category-specific model
ready files, such as the model-ready files for nonpoint (stationary
area) only, nonroad mobile only, etc. The `merge`{.filename}
subdirectory contains the final model-ready files. The following list
provides the logical names and descriptions of each of the files in the
basic configuration case.

::: {.itemizedlist}
-   `run_$ESCEN`{.filename}/output/merge:

    ::: {.itemizedlist}
    -   [**For CMAQ:**]{.bold}

        `EGTS3D_L`{.envar}: CMAQ 3-D hourly, gridded, speciated
        emissions file, excluding PinG emissions (from the **Smkmerge**
        program).

    -   [**For CMAQ only:**]{.bold}

        `PINGTS_L`{.envar}: Optional file that includes the hourly
        emissions for PinG stacks (or grouped stacks) for each hour
        (from **Smkmerge**).

        `STACK_GROUPS`{.envar}: Optional file that identifies PinG
        stacks (or grouped stacks), their locations, and stack
        parameters (from the **Elevpoint** program).

    -   [**For UAM or CAM~X~:**]{.bold}

        `EGTS_L`{.envar}: I/O API version of the 2-D merged low-level,
        hourly, gridded, speciated emissions file (from **Smkmerge**).

        `EGTS_UAM`{.envar}: Fortran binary 2-D merged low-level hourly,
        gridded, speciated emissions file (from the **Smk2emis**
        program).

        `ELEVTS_L`{.envar}: ASCII elevated-point-source stack parameters
        and hourly, speciated emissions (from **Smkmerge**).
    :::

-   `run_$ESCEN`{.filename}/output/`$SPC`{.envar}:

    ::: {.itemizedlist}
    -   `AGTS_L`{.envar} and `AGTS_S`{.envar}: Nonpoint (stationary
        area) and optionally nonroad mobile-source hourly, gridded,
        speciated emissions (from the **Smkmerge** program).

    -   `B3GTS_L`{.envar} and `B3GTS_S`{.envar}: Biogenic hourly,
        gridded, speciated emissions in moles/hour and tons/hour (from
        the **Tmpbeis3** program).

    -   `B3GTS_L_O`{.envar} and `B3GTS_S_O`{.envar}: **Tmpbeis3** output
        with the correct units needed by the AQM (from the **Smkmerge**
        program).

    -   `MGTS_L`{.envar} and `MGTS_S`{.envar}: On-road mobile-source
        hourly, gridded, speciated emissions (from **Smkmerge**).

    -   `NGTS_L`{.envar} and `NGTS_S`{.envar}: Nonroad mobile-source
        hourly, gridded, speciated emissions in moles/hour and
        grams/hour (these files are written by **Smkmerge** as an
        `AGTS_L`{.envar} or `AGTS_S`{.envar} file, with the scripts
        changing the files to the `NGTS`{.envar} name).

    -   `PGTS_L`{.envar} and `PGTS_S`{.envar}: Point-surce hourly,
        gridded, speciated emissions (from **Smkmerge**). This file
        would be created when modeling for UAM or CAM~X~, which need the
        low-level point sources but not the 3-D point sources. This file
        would not include the elevated-point-source emissions if it were
        created using the `SMK_ASCIIELEV_YN`{.envar} = Y setting.

    -   `PGTS3D_L`{.envar} and `PGTS3D_S`{.envar}: Point-source 3-D,
        hourly, gridded, speciated emissions (from **Smkmerge**). This
        file would be created for CMAQ only, using the elevated layer
        fraction, which requires the option `MRG_LAYERS_YN`{.envar} = Y.

The output file locations for the growth and control cases follow the
same paradigm described in [Section 3.2.4.3, "Configuration for growth
and/or control
case"](ch03s02s04.html#sect_dirs_location_intmed_growth "3.2.4.3. Configuration for growth and/or control case")
for the intermediate files. The `$fyr2`{.envar} and/or
`$CNTLCASE`{.envar} environment variable values are inserted into the
directory structure, as shown in [Figure 3.6, "Locations of intermediate
and output files for SMOKE future-/past-year
case"](ch03s02s04.html#fig_dirs_files_growth "Figure 3.6. Locations of intermediate and output files for SMOKE future-/past-year case").
The output directories are then reset as follows:

Future/past-year case (no controls):

::: {.itemizedlist}
-   `run_$ESCEN`{.filename}\_`$fyr2`{.envar}/output/merge: Final
    model-ready output files. The files are the same as those in the
    base case, but with future-year emissions; see [Section 3.2.5.1,
    "Configuration for base
    case"](ch03s02s05.html#sect_dirs_location_output_base "3.2.5.1. Configuration for base case")
    for more information.

-   `run_$ESCEN`{.filename}\_`$fyr2`{.envar}/output/`$SPC`{.envar}:
    Source-category hourly, gridded, speciated files. In the advanced
    configuration, the `$ASCEN`{.envar}, `$MSCEN`{.envar}, or
    `$PSCEN`{.envar} values could be different from the `$ESCEN`{.envar}
    value, resulting in separate directories (as shown in [Figure 3.5,
    "Locations of intermediate and output files for SMOKE base case,
    advanced
    configuration"](ch03s02s04.html#fig_dirs_files_advanced "Figure 3.5. Locations of intermediate and output files for SMOKE base case, advanced configuration"),
    but with the `$fyr2`{.envar} field included in the path name. The
    files are the same as those in the base case, but with future-year
    emissions; see [Section 3.2.5.1, "Configuration for base
