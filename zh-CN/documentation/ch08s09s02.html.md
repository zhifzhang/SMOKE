This file provides mapping between reference SCC (i.e., SCC8) and full
SCC (i.e., SCC10) for **Movesmrg** to convert reference SCC-level
inventory to full SCC inventory. Although it shares the same format of
[Table 8.97, "Delimited format for
`SCCXREF`{.envar}"](ch08s10s11.html#tbl_input_sccxref "Table 8.97. Delimited format for SCCXREF"),
this input file is designed for RatePerDistance (RPD) mode run in
**Movesmrg** for users to allow to map aggregated SCC-level averaged
speed (AVGSPD) distribution profiles to full SCCs in RPD mode run:

:::

The `CFPRO`{.envar} file is used to allow the user to apply factors to
**Movesmrg** to control hourly emission rates from all MOVES lookup
tables (i.e., RatePerDistance, RatePerVehicle, RatePerHour, and
RatePerProfile). Its format is shown in [Table 8.60, "Format for
`CFPRO`{.envar}"](ch08s09s02.html#tbl_input_cfpro "Table 8.60. Format for CFPRO").

A many-step hierarchy is used in applying the control factor
cross-referencing. SMOKE preferentially matches each source to the most
specific match in the file. The maximum field width in SMOKE and its
input files for SCC is 20 characters as of SMOKE v4.0. The 8 or 10 digit
SCC are still supported, but if the SCC is greater than 10 digits the
SCC hierarchial approach will not be supported.
