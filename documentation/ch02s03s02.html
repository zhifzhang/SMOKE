            <p>Emission inventories are divided into several source categories. These divisions stem from both differing methods for preparing
               the inventories and from different characteristics and attributes of the categories (more on these terms later). Generally,
               emission inventories are divided into the following source categories:
            </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
               <ul type="disc">
                  <li>
                     <p><span class="bold"><strong>Stationary area/Nonpoint sources:</strong></span> Sources that are treated as being spread over a spatial extent (usually a county or air district) and that are not moveable
                        (as compared to nonroad mobile and on-road mobile sources). Because it is not possible to collect the emissions at each point
                        of emission, they are estimated over larger regions. The EPA introduced the term &#8220;<span class="quote">nonpoint</span>&#8221; to replace &#8220;<span class="quote">stationary area</span>&#8221; in order to avoid confusion with the term &#8220;<span class="quote">area source</span>&#8221;, which is used as a regulatory term in the toxics realm. However, &#8220;<span class="quote">nonpoint</span>&#8221; has not gained acceptance (thus far) by the criteria inventory/modeling community. Thus, in this manual we will use the
                        term &#8220;<span class="quote">stationary area</span>&#8221; to refer to these sources when they are in criteria inventories, while we use the term &#8220;<span class="quote">nonpoint</span>&#8221; to refer to these sources when they are in toxics inventories. Examples of nonpoint or stationary area sources are residential
                        heating and architectural coatings. Numerous sources, such as dry cleaning facilities, may be treated either as stationary
                        area/nonpoint sources or as point sources; in particular, the toxics inventory contains numerous small sources (based on emissions)
                        that are not inventoried as nonpoint sources because their locations are known and are provided.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p><span class="bold"><strong>Nonroad mobile sources:</strong></span> Vehicular and otherwise movable sources that do not include vehicles that travel on roadways. These sources are also computed
                        as being spread over a spatial extent (again, a county or air district). Examples of nonroad mobile sources include locomotives,
                        lawn and garden equipment, construction vehicles, and boating emissions. These sources are included in both criteria and toxics
                        inventories.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p><span class="bold"><strong>On-road mobile sources:</strong></span> Vehicular sources that travel on roadways. These sources can be computed either as being spread over a spatial extent or
                        as being assigned to a line location (called a link). Data in on-road inventories can be either emissions or activity data.
                        Activity data consists of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and, optionally, vehicle speed. Activity data are used when SMOKE will
                        be computing emission factors via another model such as MOVES. Examples of on-road mobile sources include light-duty gasoline
                        vehicles and heavy-duty diesel vehicles. On-road mobile sources are included in both criteria and toxics inventories.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p><span class="bold"><strong>Point sources:</strong></span> These are sources that are identified by point locations, typically because they are regulated and their locations are available
                        in regulatory reports. Point sources are often further subdivided into electric generating utilities (EGUs) and non-EGU sources,
                        particularly in criteria inventories in which EGUs are a primary source of NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>. Examples of non-EGU point sources include chemical manufacturers and furniture refinishers. Point sources are included in
                        both the criteria and toxics inventories.
                     </p>

                  <li>
                     <p><span class="bold"><strong>Wildfire sources:</strong></span> Traditionally, wildfire emissions have been treated as stationary area sources. More recently, data have also been developed
                        for point locations, with day-specific emissions and hour-specific plume rise (vertical distribution of emissions). In this
                        case, the wildfire emissions are processed by SMOKE as point sources.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p><span class="bold"><strong>Biogenic land use data:</strong></span> Biogenic land use data characterize the type of vegetation that exists in either county total or grid cell values. The biogenic
                        land use data in North American is available using two different sets of land use categories: the Biogenic Emissions Landcover
                        Database (BELD) version 2 (BELD2), and the BELD version 3 (BELD3).

            </div>
            <p>Emission processing in SMOKE is divided into four processing categories: area, biogenic, mobile, and point. The definitions
               of these categories that SMOKE uses are different than those used for defining emission inventories. <a href="ch02s03s02.html#tbl_concepts_inv_categories" title="Table&nbsp;2.1.&nbsp;Inventory source categories and SMOKE processing capabilities and categories">Table&nbsp;2.1, &#8220;Inventory source categories and SMOKE processing capabilities and categories&#8221;</a> lists the inventory source categories, the types of inventories (activity data, criteria, particulates, and toxics) that
               SMOKE can process, the temporal resolution that is acceptable to SMOKE, and the SMOKE processing category that should be used
               for processing the inventory.

                           fuel loading, and fire start/end hour. The size of area burned and fuel loading are used for computing the fire-specific plume

                        <p><span class="bold"><strong>Source attributes:</strong></span> Like other source categories, inventory year is associated with all sources in the inventory input files. SMOKE also assigns
                           a time zone (see <a href="ch02s09s14.html" title="2.9.14.&nbsp;Assign country codes, years, and time zones">Section&nbsp;2.9.14, &#8220;Assign country codes, years, and time zones&#8221;</a>) and will re-normalize temporal profiles based on the starting and ending hours of the fire. In addition, wildfire sources
                           require the latitude and longitude source attributes to locate the fire. Note that all emissions for a fire will be assumed
                           to come from the single grid cell that contains the latititude and longitude of the fire. Finally, additional day-specific
                           source attributes listed above for fire sources <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be provided for calculating the heat flux of each fire, which is used to estimate the fraction of emissions in the surface
                           layer, the height of the bottom of the plume, and the height of the top of the plume. See more information about how to process
