         <p>Some area/nonpoint and nonroad mobile sources can be assigned point-source locations instead of being assigned spatial surrogates.
            At this time, the only allowable cases of this are for toxics processing for nonroad mobile and stationary area/nonpoint sources
            related to airport emissions processes. <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> has the capability to make such assignments for any area source from both the toxics and criteria inventories; the example
            file that comes with SMOKE for this purpose (the <code class="envar">ARTOPNT</code> file) only contains entries for the airport emissions processes. <a href="ch04s02.html" title="4.2.&nbsp;Test case descriptions">Section&nbsp;4.2, &#8220;Test case descriptions&#8221;</a> provides more information about the example <code class="envar">ARTOPNT</code> file provided with SMOKE.
         </p>
         <p>Because airport location data are readily available, this feature gives users the ability to model airport-related area-source
            emissions at airport locations, as opposed to spatially allocating them to grid cells using spatial surrogates. Although spatial
            surrogates could be (and have been) developed to reproduce the same or similar results as the point-source assignments for
            models such as CMAQ, other models that SMOKE may eventually support (namely ISCST3) require that point-source inputs include
            the location coordinates. The area-to-point assignment feature in SMOKE will support such a need. Note that for large airports
            and a small grid, one may want to have the airport emissions gridded using surrogate data since the airport can be large enough
            to encompass multiple grid cells. Thus, the user should decide whether and when to use this area-to-point feature as opposed
            to gridding using an airport surrogate.
         </p>
         <p>In SMOKE version 1.5 and higher, SMOKE can assign an area source to one or more locations in a county. For example, when multiple
            airports are in a county, SMOKE adds sources to the inventory and splits the county-total emissions among the locations based
            on a factor provided in the <code class="envar">ARTOPNT</code> file. All sources remain with the area-source inventory in which they started; they are not moved to a point-source inventory.
            Any area sources that are assigned point locations are spatially allocated using those locations, as described in <a href="ch02s12.html" title="2.12.&nbsp;Spatial processing">Section&nbsp;2.12, &#8220;Spatial processing&#8221;</a>. Sources that are not assigned point-source locations are allocated in the standard way using spatial surrogates.
