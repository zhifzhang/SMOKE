         <p>Growth processing creates emission data sets for years other than a year for which an emissions inventory is available. For
            example, if an inventory is available for 1996, but the modeling effort involves predicting ozone levels in 2007, then the
            emissions inventory must be grown to the year 2007. Previous versions of this document used the term &#8220;<span class="quote">projection</span>&#8221; for this function; in this version, however, &#8220;<span class="quote">projection</span>&#8221; refers to both growth of emissions (which is covered in this subsection) and control of emissions (addressed in <a href="ch02s14.html" title="2.14.&nbsp;Control processing">Section&nbsp;2.14, &#8220;Control processing&#8221;</a>). The <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span> program performs both growth and control functions. For growth processing, <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span> creates a growth matrix that contains the growth factors for each source and pollutant in the inventory. The <span><strong class="command">Grwinven</strong></span> program then combines the growth matrix with the emission inventory to create a grown emission inventory.
         </p>
         <p>If no new sources are being added when moving from the inventory year to the future year, then <span><strong class="command">Grwinven</strong></span> can be used with the base case inventory and the growth matrix based on it. If new sources must be added, then the data structuring
            step (performed by <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span>) must be rerun for the new number of sources, followed by running <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span> to create the growth matrix; then <span><strong class="command">Grwinven</strong></span> applies the matrix to the new inventory file. Alternatively, users may elect to prepare a future-year inventory outside of
            SMOKE and import it directly with <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span>, which skips the <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span> and <span><strong class="command">Grwinven</strong></span> steps.
         </p>
         <p><a href="ch02s13.html#fig_concepts_growth_processing" title="Figure&nbsp;2.25.&nbsp;Relationship between inventory sources and growth matrix">Figure&nbsp;2.25, &#8220;Relationship between inventory sources and growth matrix&#8221;</a> shows the relationship between the inventory and the growth matrix created by <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span>, which consists of columns for each pollutant being grown from one year to another. The entries in the matrix are the growth
            factors needed to grow the inventory to a future or past year; note that these entries can be greater than, equal to, or less
            than 1 depending on if the emissions should increase, stay the same, or decrease after the inventory is grown. If the growth
            factors are the same for every pollutant in the inventory, then only one column, called &#8220;<span class="quote">pfac</span>&#8221;, is included in the growth matrix, rather than using duplicate columns for every pollutant. The growth matrix depends only
            upon the growth factors and the inventory, so it is therefore independent of other factor-based operations for emissions processing;
            however, growth of the inventory (using the <span><strong class="command">Grwinven</strong></span> program) must occur before the temporal allocation step when creating model-ready emissions using inventories grown with
            SMOKE.

         <p><span><strong class="command">Grwinven</strong></span> combines the intermediate inventory files with one or more growth matrices to create a new intermediate inventory file with
            the same structure as the original file but with a future (or past) year stored in the header of this file.

         <p>In growth processing, the <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span> program addresses the following emissions processing needs when creating the growth matrix:

         <p>The <span><strong class="command">Grwinven</strong></span> program addresses the remaining needs to create a grown inventory:

         </div>
         <p>Each of the issues in the list above is addressed in the following subsections, in the order in which they appear in the list.</p>

            <p>The <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span> program assigns growth factors using a cross-reference approach similar to the approaches used for chemical speciation and
               gridding. <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span> reads the information about the growth factors from the /PROJECTION/ packet in the control input file (<code class="envar">GCNTL</code>). As described in detail in <a href="ch06s02.html" title="6.2.&nbsp;Cntlmat">Section&nbsp;6.2, &#8220;<span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span>&#8221;</a>, <code class="envar">GCNTL</code> can assign growth factors by state/county FIPS code, SCC, SIC, MACT, pollutant, and various combinations of these. The most
               specific entry is selected by <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span> based on the hierarchy described in <a href="ch06s02.html" title="6.2.&nbsp;Cntlmat">Section&nbsp;6.2, &#8220;<span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span>&#8221;</a>. Since the /PROJECTION/ packet includes both the cross-referencing information and the growth factors, there is no need for
               a profile file (like those used for chemical speciation). The growth factors may include both positive growth (factors greater
               than 1) or negative growth (factors less than 1) or no growth (factors equal to 1).
            </p>
            <p>The /REACTIVITY/ packet can also be used to grow emissions to a future or past year, but a different approach is used that
               includes a &#8220;<span class="quote">phase-in</span>&#8221; period and other differences. We describe this packet in <a href="ch02s14.html" title="2.14.&nbsp;Control processing">Section&nbsp;2.14, &#8220;Control processing&#8221;</a>.
