         <p>The spatial processing operation, or <span class="emphasis"><em>gridding</em></span>, combines the grid specification for the air-quality modeling domain with source locations from the SMOKE inventory file.
            The resulting gridding matrix is a sparse matrix that describes in which grid cells the emissions for each source occur within
            the modeling domain. The gridding matrix is applied to the inventory emissions to transform source-based inventory emissions
            to gridded emissions.
         </p>
         <p>The SMOKE <span><strong class="command">Grdmat</strong></span> program creates the gridding matrix for area, mobile, and point sources. The gridding step is different depending on the
            type of source being processed.
         </p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
               <li>
                  <p>For area sources, county-total emissions are spread among the cells intersecting the county through the use of gridding surrogates.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>For mobile sources, the data can be provided by county (as area sources are), or the data can be provided as line sources
                     (&#8220;<span class="quote">links</span>&#8221;). County-based mobile emissions are apportioned with gridding surrogates, preferably with surrogates based on the different
                     road types for which the mobile emissions are provided. The line-source emissions are apportioned depending on the length
                     of the link in each cell.

               </li>

                  <p>For point sources, emissions are apportioned to the grid cell intersecting the point.</p>

         <p>As shown in <a href="ch02s12.html#fig_concepts_spatial_processing" title="Figure&nbsp;2.22.&nbsp;Relationship between inventory and gridding matrix">Figure&nbsp;2.22, &#8220;Relationship between inventory and gridding matrix&#8221;</a>, the gridding matrix contains the SMOKE source IDs that intersect each grid cell, and the source-to-cell factors for each.
            The gridding matrix is a sparse matrix because each source intersects only a small number of cells relative to the total number
            of cells in the domain, and the storage format shown in the figure reflects a sparse storage format. In the example in <a href="ch02s12.html#fig_concepts_spatial_processing" title="Figure&nbsp;2.22.&nbsp;Relationship between inventory and gridding matrix">Figure&nbsp;2.22, &#8220;Relationship between inventory and gridding matrix&#8221;</a>, source 1 intersects cells 1 and 2, with 10% of the emissions in cell 1 and 30% of the emissions in cell 2. The remainder
            of the source&#8217;s emissions (60%) are either outside the grid or in other cells not shown in this example. Source 2 is completely
            inside the domain; 40% of its emissions are in cell 1, 30% are in cell 2, and 30% are in cell 4. If this were a point-source
            speciation matrix, there would be only one cell associated with each source because each point source exists in only one cell.
         </p>

         </div>
         <p>Note that the gridding matrix depends only upon the source locations, the grid definition, and in some cases gridding surrogates
            and cross-references. It is therefore independent of the other steps of emissions processing.

               </div>
            </div>
            <p>The grid for which the spatial allocation step outputs the gridding matrix depends upon the <code class="envar">IOAPI_GRIDNAME_1</code> environment variable setting and the <code class="envar">GRIDDESC</code> input file. The file contains all of the settings needed by the I/O API to define each grid (together, these settings are
               called a grid definition), and it contains many such grid definitions. The <code class="envar">IOAPI_GRIDNAME_1</code> setting selects the specific grid to use during a specific run, and it must match the grid name provided in the <code class="envar">GRIDDESC</code> file. The settings used by the I/O API to define a grid are documented as part of the <a href="http://www.baronams.com/products/ioapi/GRIDDESC.html" target="_top">I/O API web site</a>.
            </p>
            <p>There is another file format, called the <code class="envar">G_GRIDPATH</code> file, that can be provided to <span><strong class="command">Grdmat</strong></span> instead of the <code class="envar">GRIDDESC</code> file. However, the <code class="envar">G_GRIDPATH</code> format allows only one grid per file. It is included as an acceptable input to SMOKE to allow SMOKE to be backwardly compatible
               with previous versions. All new users are advised to use a single <code class="envar">GRIDDESC</code> file to store all of their modeling grids, instead of using multiple <code class="envar">G_GRIDDPATH</code> files, one for each grid. The <code class="envar">IOAPI_GRIDNAME_1</code> setting is not used by <span><strong class="command">Grdmat</strong></span> when the <code class="envar">G_GRIDPATH</code> format is used.
            </p>
            <p>The gridded region selected at run time does not need to cover all of the counties in the inventory. If the gridded region
               is smaller than the inventory, this processing step will still include the counties or parts of counties that do not overlap
               the grid. This allows users who are performing emissions processing using nested grids to import the inventory once and apply
               gridding matrices for each grid to the same inventory, creating gridded emissions for all nested grids without having to adjust
               the inventory files. The downside of this approach is that SMOKE does not give a warning if a county that is in the inventory
               is not in the spatial surrogates, or if a lat-lon coordinate is not inside the grid. It assumes that these sources are intended
               to be dropped and proceeds without comment. Thus, you must ensure that your surrogate files contain the counties in your inventory
               that are inside the grid and that your lat-lon coordinates for point and link sources are correct.
