         <p>Once the <span><strong class="command">Met4moves</strong></span> meteorology preprocessor and the MOVES model processing that results in the SMOKE-formatted emissions factor lookup tables
            are completed, we address the remaining major component of the SMOKE-MOVES tool: the SMOKE model processing step. The goals
            of this step are (1) to estimate emissions from on-road mobile sources based on MOVES-based emissions lookup tables and meteorology
            data, (2) to create hourly gridded speciated air quality model-ready input files, and (3) to produce various types of reports
            for the user.
         </p>
         <p>As some readers are aware, MOBILE6 and MOVES are both vehicle emissions modeling systems used with SMOKE. However, they differ
            in their approaches to calculating off-network evaporative emissions. In MOBILE6, off-network emissions processes are calculated
            as emission factors in grams/mile, which is related to Vehicle Mileage Travelled (VMT). MOVES, on the other hand, uses the
            source (vehicle) type population (VPOP) to calculate start and off-network evaporative emissions, which are assigned to off-network
            emissions processes; these processes are hour-dependent due to VPOP (activity) assumptions built into the MOVES model. Thus,
            compared to the SMOKE-MOBILE6 approach, the SMOKE-MOVES approach requires additional vehicle population inventory data as
            input for estimating mobile-source emissions from off-network emissions processes. This requirement is reflected in the discussion
            below.
         </p>
         <p>When processing mobile-source emissions from MOVES, SMOKE performs the following basic steps.</p>

         <p>The way the MOVES-generated emissions factor lookup tables are used varies according to whether SMOKE is modeling on-roadway
            emission processes or off-network emissions processes.
         </p>
         <p>On-roadway emission processes: When estimates of all on-roadway emission processes except for extended idle exhaust are needed,
            SMOKE requires county-total VMT and average hourly speed (SPEED) inventory data as inputs to a SMOKE postprocessor called
            <span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span> which is part of the SMOKE-MOVES tool. When extended idle exhaust process is estimated, counthy-total HOTELLING activity
            data is needed for <span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span>. <span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span> uses <a href="ch02s16s02.html#tbl_concepts_moves_lookup_tbl_sm_format" title="Table&nbsp;2.11.&nbsp;MOVES Emission Rate Lookup Table (SMOKE Format)">the SMOKE-ready MOVES RPD and RPH lookup tables</a> as an input to estimate on-road sources emission. The key lookup fields for RPD are gridded hourly temperature and average
            hourly speed from the avgSpeedBinID field for RPD. SMOKE interpolates in the emission factors lookup table (in unit of grams/mile)
            based on gridded hourly temperature and average speed. <a href="ch02s08s04.html#fig_concepts_mobile_moves_onroad" title="Figure&nbsp;2.13.&nbsp;MOVES mobile RatePerDistance processing steps">Figure&nbsp;2.13, &#8220;MOVES mobile RatePerDistance processing steps&#8221;</a> shows processing steps for on-roadway emissions processes in the SMOKE system using VMT and SPEED activity inventory data.
            For RPH, the gridded houlry temperature is used to interpolate in the emission factors lookup table (in unit of grams/hour).
         </p>
         <p>Off-network emission processes: When estimates are needed for off-network emissions processes, including the off-network vapor
            venting emissions process, SMOKE uses county-total VPOP by vehicle type as input to <span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span> together with the SMOKE-ready RatePerVehicle (RPV) and RatePerProfile (RPP) lookup tables. <a href="ch02s08s04.html#fig_concepts_mobile_moves_offroad" title="Figure&nbsp;2.14.&nbsp;MOVES mobile RatePerVehicle and RatPereProfile (off-network) processing steps">Figure&nbsp;2.14, &#8220;MOVES mobile RatePerVehicle and RatPereProfile (off-network) processing steps&#8221;</a> shows processing steps for off-network emissions processes in the SMOKE modeling system using vehicle population activity
            inventory data. A significant difference in the processing steps between the on-roadway emissions processes (RPD table) and
            the off-network emissions processes (RPV and RPP tables) is that off-network emissions processing does not require the <span><strong class="command">Temporal</strong></span> program step because vehicle population (VPOP) does not need to be temporally allocated. In the RPV table, gridded hourly
            temperature and hour of the day are the key lookup fields SMOKE uses to estimate hourly off-network emissions in unit of grams/vehicle/hour.
            For the evaporative fuel off-network vapor venting emissions process only, <span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span> uses the RPP lookup table to estimate the emission rates based on the minimum and maximum temperatures computed by <span><strong class="command">Met4moves</strong></span>.
         </p>
         <p>For all SMOKE-ready three emission rate lookup tables (RPD, RPV, RPP), SMOKE performs linear interpolation when using them.</p>
