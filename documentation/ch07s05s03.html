         <p>In addition to log files, some SMOKE programs also create reports. These reports can help provide quality assurance concerning
            the steps taken by the program. The programs and their associated reports and uses are as follows:
         </p>
         <p><span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span>: Creates the <code class="envar">REPINVEN</code> file, which documents the inventory data read, which data where kept, and the inventory totals for each data value. It also
            includes the area-to-point conversion information.
         </p>
         <p><span><strong class="command">Laypoint</strong></span>: Creates the <code class="envar">REPRTLAY</code> file, which documents any point sources for which the <span><strong class="command">Laypoint</strong></span> program computed a plume rise into a layer greater than the layer number set by the <code class="envar">REP_LAYER_MAX</code> setting.
         </p>
         <p><span><strong class="command">Spcmat</strong></span>: Creates the <code class="envar">ASSUP</code>, <code class="envar">MSSUP</code>, and <code class="envar">PSSUP</code> files, which include the speciation profile codes assigned to each source by pollutant. These files can be used with the
            ASCII component of the SMOKE intermediate inventory file (<code class="envar">AREA</code>, <code class="envar">MOBL</code>, and <code class="envar">PNTS</code>) to quickly determine the speciation profile assigned to a specific source. These files are also input files to the <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> program, for creating more involved summaries of emissions and/or sources including the speciation profiles.
         </p>
         <p><span><strong class="command">Grdmat</strong></span>: Creates the <code class="envar">AGSUP</code> and <code class="envar">MGSUP</code> files, which include the spatial surrogate codes assigned to each source. They also indicate whether that assignment was
            a fallback or original assignment. This file can be used with the ASCII component of the SMOKE intermediate inventory file
            (<code class="envar">AREA</code> and <code class="envar">MOBL</code>) to quickly determine the spatial surrogate assigned to a specific source. These files can also be used by the <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> program, for creating more involved summaries of emissions and/or sources including the spatial surrogate codes.
         </p>
         <p><span><strong class="command">Temporal</strong></span>: Creates the <code class="envar">ATSUP</code>, <code class="envar">MTSUP</code>, and <code class="envar">PTSUP</code> files, which include the monthly, weekly, and diurnal profile codes assigned to each source for each pollutant. These files
            can be used with the ASCII component of the SMOKE intermediate inventory file (<code class="envar">AREA</code>, <code class="envar">MOBL</code>, and <code class="envar">PNTS</code>) to quickly determine the temporal profiles assigned to a specific source. When no pollutant-specific temporal profile assignments
            have been made, these files can also be used by the <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> program, for creating more involved summaries of emissions and/or sources including the temporal profile codes.
         </p>
         <p><span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span>: Writes several report files (documented with the <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span> program in <a href="ch06.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;SMOKE Core Programs">Chapter&nbsp;6, <i>SMOKE Core Programs</i></a>) that summarize the growth and control factors. Separate reports are written for each type of projection (growth, multiplicative
            control, reactivity control) with emissions before and after each control. Another report is written that summarizes all projections
            made to each source.
         </p>
         <p><span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span>: Writes a report of state and/or county totals that are created at the same time as the model-ready files. These totals are
            guaranteed to match the actual state/county totals in the model-ready gridded, hourly outputs (unless there is a problem introduced
            into <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span>). These reports are useful even though they duplicate the <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> reports in some ways, because they allow you to ensure that the <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> totals and <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> totals are the same - indicating that <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> was run with the correct files. Because <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> is run separately from <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span>, this is not necessarily the case, so you should confirm it with the <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> report.
