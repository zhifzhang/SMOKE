         <p>This section provides some ideas on things to check after SMOKE has been run to a successful completion (and after the other
            QA steps described above have been completed). The review steps listed here will help ensure that SMOKE is working properly.
            However, these recommendations will not enable you to identify any missing sources (the source exists but was not included
            in the inventory) or wrong emissions sources (the source is in the inventory, but the emissions are completely incorrect),
            so it is up to you to understand your emission inventory and make sure that it is representative of the emissions for the
            regions and years of interest.

                        and review these to determine if per-capita emissions differences make sense from state to state; this approach can often

                                 of the electric generating facilities (major emissions sources) are the same for all days of the week because the power plants
                                 never shut down and their emissions do not depend much on the day of the week. Emissions for major manufacturing plants will
                                 often be closed completely on weekends and have no emissions. If using an average-day inventory (not an annual inventory),
                                 confirm that monthly adjustments have not been made. Check that any holiday days have been processed as directed based on
                                 the <code class="envar">HOLIDAYS</code> files (e.g., that weekday holidays have been processed as Sundays).

                              <p>If using day-specific or hour-specific inventory data, then it will be harder to compare the inventory totals before input
                                 to SMOKE to the emissions totals after temporal processing. This is because part of a state/county total when using hour-day-
                                 or hour-specific data include these data and part do not, but the inventory totals are often available only for the annual
                                 and/or average-day emissions values. This limitation can be rectified by calculating the emissions totals for the day- and
                                 hour-specific data outside of SMOKE, and analyzing these sources by SCC instead of only by state/county to separate the analysis
                                 of the annual and/or average-day emissions from the analysis of the day- and/or hour-specific emissions.

                        with an independent assessment of the state/county. Major sources should be reviewed for correct emissions and correct locations.
