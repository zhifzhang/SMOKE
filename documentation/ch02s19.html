         <p>Creating emissions with SMOKE using MOVES lookup tables (i.e., RatePerDistance [RPD], RatePerHour [RPH], RatePerVehicle [RPV]
            and RatePerProfile [RPP] ) must always include merging the gridding matrices from <span><strong class="command">Grdmat</strong></span> and the chemical speciation matrices from <span><strong class="command">Spcmat</strong></span>. In addition, for RPD emissions based on VMT data by source for CMAQ, creating the model-ready emissions must also include
            merging with the hourly VMT from <span><strong class="command">Temporal</strong></span>. The <span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span> program performs these processing steps using vector-matrix multiplication to combine the matrices and the hourly emissions
            vectors to create CMAQ-ready gridded and speciated hourly emissions input data.
         </p>
         <p>If the overall SMOKE processing setup includes running the nonroad mobile category (or other source categories) as separate
            runs (see <a href="ch04.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;How to Use SMOKE">Chapter&nbsp;4, <i>How to Use SMOKE</i></a>, then <span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span> cannot be used to combine all source categories into a single output file. Instead, the <a href="ch06s10.html" title="6.10.&nbsp;Mrggrid"><span><strong class="command">Mrggrid</strong></span></a> program would combine the model-ready files from the individual source categories; for example, from separate SMOKE (including
            <span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span>) runs for RPD, RPV and RPP mobile sources. There is no limit to the number of model-ready files that <span><strong class="command">Mrggrid</strong></span> can combine into a single model-ready file, and the input files can be 2-D or 3-D.
         </p>
         <p><span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span> can be used only for MOVES-based mobile SMOKE source categories. It can use only one of each MOVES lookup table (RPD, RPH,
            RPV and RPV) per run. You can run it to create model-ready files for only one SMOKE source category (RPD, RPH, RPV, and RPP).
            The following list indicates the modes in which <span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span> can be run:
         </p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
               <li>
                  <p>Run for MOVES RPD mobile sources based on VMT data by vehicle and road types to create gridded, hourly, speciated emissions
                     in moles/hour or moles/second.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Run for MOVES RPH mobile sources based on vehicle hotelling (HOTELLING) hours activity data by vehicle and road types to create
                     gridded, hourly, speciated emissions in moles/hour or moles/second.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Run for MOVES RPV mobile sources based on Vehicle population (VPOP) data by vehicle to create gridded, hourly, speciated emissions
                     in moles/hour or moles/second.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Run for MOVES RPP mobile sources based on Vehicle population (VPOP) data by vehicle to create gridded, hourly, speciated emissions
                     in moles/hour or moles/second.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Run to create daily total emissions report by county, by state, and by SCC in the unit of tons/day or tons/hour.</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>Many processing steps in SMOKE are independent of one another; for example, chemical speciation and temporal allocation can
            change without affecting one another. This independence means that when one step changes, another step does not need to be
            rerun in many cases. However, because <span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span> combines the data from all of these processing steps to create the model-ready emissions, if one of the earlier steps changes,
            then the merging step must also be rerun. This includes rerunning <span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span> to generate model-ready files, and if the <span><strong class="command">Mrggrid</strong></span> program was used, also rerunning that to merge data from multiple source categories together.
         </p>
         <p><span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span> also has the ability to input hourly emissions by day of the week and reuse days that are the same. For example, it can input
            separate hourly emissions files for Monday, a weekday, Saturday, and Sunday, and use these four files to generate model-ready
            emissions for every day in an entire month. This is accomplished using the <code class="envar">MRG_BYDAY</code> SMOKE option, described further in <a href="ch06s08.html" title="6.8.&nbsp;Movesmrg">Section&nbsp;6.8, &#8220;<span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span>&#8221;</a>. Special treatment can also be given to holidays in this case, since users generally wish to model holidays differently than
            other days.
