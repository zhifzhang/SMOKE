         <p>The <code class="envar">INVTABLE</code> file replaces the <code class="envar">SIPOLS</code> and <code class="envar">ACTVNAMS</code> files previously used by SMOKE. <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> uses the inventory table to select the inventory pollutants that will be output by <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span>. The valid pollutants are again checked at the end of SMOKE processing by <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span>, to ensure that the program knows about all of the pollutants and also to set the order of the output variables (output species
            are sorted by the order of the pollutants in the inventory table and for multiple species per pollutant, by alphabetical order).
            You can use the <code class="envar">INVTABLE</code> to drop inventory pollutants in <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> without having to modify the inventory files, simply by modifying <code class="envar">INVTABLE</code>. The units used in the SMOKE intermediate files are listed in this file. The SMOKE programs <span><strong class="command">Spcmat</strong></span>, and <span><strong class="command">Movesmrg</strong></span> use this file to determine which pollutants should be included in the NONHAPVOC or NONHAPTOG calculation.
         </p>
         <p>The inventory table also provides a way to assign the SPECIATE4 species ID to any pollutant that is a Hazardous Air Pollutant
            (HAP) VOC. This assignment is not used directly by SMOKE, but rather is used by the Speciation Tool when creating VOC speciation
            profiles.  This is used only when creating speciation profiles to support SMOKE runs that will combine criteria VOC and HAP
            VOC emissions, using the <code class="envar">NHAPEXCLUDE</code> file in the <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> program. More specifically, this can be done for the purpose of using VOC HAP emissions to augment VOC speciation profiles.
            Since the Inventory Table provides information to the Speciation Tool, this field is not used by SMOKE, but is included for
            continued integration of SMOKE inputs with the Speciation Tool.
         </p>
         <p> As described in the <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> documentation in Chapter 6, <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> in some cases will create "no-integrate" (NOI) HAP pollutant emissions from the inventory data by renaming the pollutant
            with a "_NOI" suffix applied to the end of the Inventory Data Name from the Inventory Table for such pollutants. Similarly,
            <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> will automatically add all possibly needed "_NOI" pollutant names to the internal master list of valid pollutant names. This
            list would otherwise be limited to the contents of the <code class="envar">INVTABLE</code> file entries where the Keep column contains an "Y".  <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> inserts these names in the master list such that the "_NOI" version of the pollutant name appears in the list just after
            the polutant on which the name is based.  The inserted entries that include "_NOI" are made when the following values are
            included for the pollutant in the <code class="envar">INVTABLE</code> file.
         </p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">

               <li>

         </div>
         <p>It is possible for a user to choose two pollutants that result in double counting the emissions from the inventory. For example,
            you may want to model both benzo(a)pyrene and 7-PAH which, would result in the emissions associated with CAS number 205992
            (for benzo(a)pyrene) to be duplicated. The user is responsible for the choices made and the resulting changes in inventory
            mass.

         <p>The columns in the <code class="envar">INVTABLE</code> are used as follows:
         </p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
               <li>
                  <p>Inventory data name: Unique name for pollutant or activity that will be stored and processed by SMOKE. Because of I/O API
                     restrictions, these names can only include alphanumeric characters and underscores, and the first character must be a letter.
                     In addition, because SMOKE uses double-underscore as a separator when appending to variable names, no double-underscores are
                     permitted in these names.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Mode: This three-letter code represents the emissions mode that SMOKE uses to augment the pollutant names. Emissions mode
                     usually refers to the on-road or nonroad mobile exhaust or evaporative emissions. If present in a record of the Inventory
                     Table, SMOKE will combine the Mode field with the Inventory Data Name field using a double underscore. So, if the Inventory
                     Data Name is "VOC" and the Mode is "EXH", then the pollutant name in SMOKE intermediate files will be stored as "EXH__VOC".
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Inventory Pollutant Code: This code represents the pollutant that is provided in the inventory file input into SMOKE, and
                     is sometimes the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number when the inventory uses CAS numbers to identify pollutants. <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> matches this code to a ORL-formatted inventory file to assign the combination of Mode and Inventory Data Name (columns 2
                     and 1 as described in the previous bullet), which is used in all subsequent SMOKE intermediate files and reports. This code
                     is not used by SMOKE in any other way.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>SPECIATE4 ID: The SPECIATE4 ID is the unique species identifier in SPECIATE4 (the "ID" field in the SPECIES_PROPERTIES table).
                     This code is not used by SMOKE, but rather is used during import of the Inventory Table to the Speciation Tool.

               <li>

               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Keep: Indicates whether SMOKE should keep the CAS number associated with this inventory data name. SMOKE will keep any inventory
                     data with at least one CAS number with a Y.

               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Factor: The adjustment factor to use in splitting the emissions associated with a CAS number into different inventory data
                     names, or reducing the mass of a metal compound associated with a CAS number to account for the metal mass only.

The pollutant can be an explicit
                     species in the chemical mechanism only when the <code class="envar">GSPRO</code> file definitions of the lumped VOC species have been adjusted to account for the pollutants/species that are explicit in
                     the mechanism. The current explicit-in-mechanism species being used in the toxics CB6 mechanism for CMAQ are formaldehyde,
