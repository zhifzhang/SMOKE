                     SMOKE area sources are defined by country, state, and county codes and by source category codes (SCCs). Area sources are also
                     referred to as stationary area sources and, in SMOKE, include nonroad mobile sources.

                  <p>Emission inventories are developed for a variety of purposes. Inventories of natural and anthropogenic emissions are used
                     by scientists as inputs to air quality models, by policy makers to develop strategies and policies or track progress of standards,
                     and by facilities and regulatory agencies to establish compliance records with allowable emission rates. A well constructed
                     inventory should include enough documentation and other data to allow readers to understand the underlying assumptions and
                     to reconstruct the calculations for each of the estimates included.

                     another year and applying emissions controls on the inventory. This process requires a large number of supplementary data
                     files include gridding surrogates, cross-reference files, and factor profiles for chemical speciation and temporal allocation.

                     model. Emissions processing typically includes quality assurance to increase user confidence that the data were converted

                  <p>The concept of a fuel month is used to indicate when a particular set of fuel properties should be used in a MOVES simulation.
                      The fuel month reduces the computational time of MOVES by using a single month to represent a set of months.  To determine
                     the fuel month and which months it is similar to, the user should review the State-provided fuel supply data in the MOVES
                     database for each representative county.  If the fuel supply data change thoughout the year, then roup the months by fuel
                     parameters.  For example, if the grams/mile exhaust emission rates in January are identical to February's rates for a given
                     representative county, then use a single fuel month to represent January and Febuary. (Only one of the months needs to be
