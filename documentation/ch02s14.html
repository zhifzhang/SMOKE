         <p>The control processing operation applies control factors from a control input file (<code class="envar">GCNTL</code>) based on source characteristics in the inventory. A control scenario involves changing the values of emissions based on
            regulations affecting industrial activities or personal behaviors. The resulting control matrix, created by the <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span> program, takes the form of the matrix shown in <a href="ch02s13.html#fig_concepts_growth_processing" title="Figure&nbsp;2.25.&nbsp;Relationship between inventory sources and growth matrix">Figure&nbsp;2.25, &#8220;Relationship between inventory sources and growth matrix&#8221;</a>. The control matrix depends only upon the source characteristics in the SMOKE inventory and the set of controls chosen, so
            control processing can therefore be decoupled from the rest of the processing steps. The <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span> program performs control processing for SMOKE area, mobile, and point sources; however, much more complex controls for on-road
            mobile sources can also be implemented when using MOVES through SMOKE to calculate emission factors and apply them to VMT.
         </p>
         <p>The emissions control factors can be applied in addition to the emissions growth factors (described in <a href="ch02s13.html" title="2.13.&nbsp;Growth processing">Section&nbsp;2.13, &#8220;Growth processing&#8221;</a>), and the net effect of this growth and control is called &#8220;<span class="quote">projection</span>&#8221;. SMOKE control processing can create two types of control matrices during a given run: a multiplicative control matrix and
            a reactivity control matrix.
         </p>
         <p>The <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span> program performs the following emissions processing steps in creating the control matrices:
         </p>
         <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol type="1">
               <li>
                  <p>Assigning control factors from six control packets to the sources</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Creating the multiplicative control matrix</p>

               <li>
                  <p>Creating the reactivity control matrix</p>

               <li>
                  <p>Reporting on factors assigned to each source in the inventory</p>
               </li>
            </ol>
         </div>
         <p>The <span><strong class="command">Grwinven</strong></span> program addresses the following control processing steps:
         </p>
         <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol start="5" type="1">
               <li>
                  <p>Applying the multiplicative control matrices to the inventory</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Creating a controlled intermediate inventory file</p>
               </li>
            </ol>
         </div>
         <p>Finally, the <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> program can be used to perform the following control processing step:
         </p>
         <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol start="7" type="1">
               <li>
                  <p>Applying the multiplicative and/or reactivity control matrices to the inventory to create model-ready inputs</p>
               </li>
            </ol>
         </div>

            <p>SMOKE provides six control packets with which users can control emissions:</p>

                  <li>
                     <p>/MACT/ contains MACT-based assignments for toxics inventories and can be used to apply general MACT controls to sources affected
                        by MACT regulations. This packet contributes to the multiplicative control matrix.
                     </p>

                  <li>

                        any combination of source characteristics, even targeting a specific source. This packet contributes to the multiplicative
                        control matrix. This packet cannot appear in the same input file with an /EMS_CONTROL/ packet.

It also contains a point-source conversion factor and an aggregated control factor that can override everything
                        else in the packet. This packet contributes to the multiplicative control matrix. This packet cannot appear in the same input
                        file with a /CONTROL/ packet, and it can be used for point sources only.

                  <li>
                     <p>/CTG/ contains settings for control technology guideline (CTG) controls, MACT controls, and reasonably available control technology
                        (RACT) controls. It contributes to the multiplicative control matrix.

                  <li>
                     <p>/ALLOWABLE/ contains county-specific, SIC-specific, SCC-specific controls, caps, and replacement emissions. It contributes
                        to the multiplicative control matrix.

All
               packets can be included in a single <span><strong class="command">Cntlmat</strong></span> run, with the exception of the /CONTROL/ and /EMS_CONTROL/ packets (either one or the other of these can be included, but
               not both). In general, these packets can assign control factors by state/county FIPS code, SCC, SIC, MACT, pollutant, other
               plant-specific source characteristics, and various combinations of these.
