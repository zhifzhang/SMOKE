         <p>As introduced in <a href="ch02s05s03.html" title="2.5.3.&nbsp;Model-ready files">Section&nbsp;2.5.3, &#8220;Model-ready files&#8221;</a> and further explained in <a href="ch02s08s05.html" title="2.8.5.&nbsp;Point-source processing">Section&nbsp;2.8.5, &#8220;Point-source processing&#8221;</a>, there are two major approaches to processing elevated point sources for air quality modeling. The first approach is to have
            SMOKE compute the layer assignments for the point sources; this method is used for the CMAQ model. The second approach, which
            is used for the UAM models and CAM<sub>X</sub>, is to select specific sources as elevated and then create a special elevated-point-source file that contains the information
            needed so that the AQM can compute the plume rise. In both cases, users can select elevated sources specifically (in the second
            approach, that selection is mandatory). Also, PinG sources can be selected in both cases.
         </p>
         <p>The two approaches have some steps that are the same and some that are different. The rest of this section is split into the
            following two subsections, one for each elevated-point-source processing approach:

            <p>The CMAQ model requires the layer fractions for elevated point sources to be computed by SMOKE. To do this, SMOKE performs
               the following steps:
            </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">

                        can optionally read the output file from <span><strong class="command">Elevpoint</strong></span> to identify the elevated sources, but otherwise will compute plume rise for <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> sources.

                     <p>Uses the <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> program to combine the layer fractions with the hourly emissions to generate the model-ready output files and optionally

               <p><span><strong class="command">Elevpoint</strong></span> can select elevated and PinG sources using multiple criteria based on emissions values, emissions rank, stack parameters,
                  plant numbers, and an analytical plume rise calculation. The elevated criteria and PinG criteria are provided to <span><strong class="command">Elevpoint</strong></span> using a file called <code class="envar">PELVCONFIG</code>. You must configure this file to contain the criteria needed to select elevated and PinG source (if these selection are needed
                  at all). If emissions values is one of the criteria, the <span><strong class="command">Elevpoint</strong></span> program reads all of the hourly point-source files using the <code class="envar">PTMPLIST</code> file. This file is a list of all <code class="envar">PTMP</code> files that will be evaluated to determine which sources have maximum daily emissions that exceed the specified selection
                  criteria or to determine the emissions rank. Only the maximum daily facility-total emissions can be used by <span><strong class="command">Elevpoint</strong></span> to select sources based on emissions.
               </p>
               <p>The elevated sources and PinG sources can each be selected using different criteria. In general, there are many more elevated
                  sources than PinG sources for typical applications of SMOKE and AQMs. <span><strong class="command">Elevpoint</strong></span> also permits you to group PinG sources and creates the <code class="envar">STACK_GROUPS</code> file so that the sources are treated as a single source in the PinG rise calculation by CMAQ. Grouping is useful to reduce
                  the total number of PinG stacks processed by CMAQ (PinG processing is a computationally expensive calculation). Using grouping
                  makes sense when several stacks at the same plant have the same, or nearly the same, stack parameters. When that is true,
                  the emissions from the multiple stacks can be grouped and treated as a single PinG stack. Finally, there are two SMOKE settings
                  (<code class="envar">SMK_ELEV_METHOD</code> and <code class="envar">SMK_PING_METHOD</code>) that instruct <span><strong class="command">Elevpoint</strong></span> and other SMOKE programs to actually use these criteria to select the elevated and PinG sources. If these settings are not
                  set to &#8220;<span class="quote">1</span>&#8221; the elevated and PinG selections will not be made, and so will not affect any further processing steps.

               <p>In this CMAQ approach, <span><strong class="command">Laypoint</strong></span> uses gridded, hourly meteorological data and stack parameters to calculate the plume rise for all point-source emissions.
                  The program&#8217;s approach is based on the Briggs algorithm, as explained in detail in <a href="ch06s03.html#sect_programs_elevpoint_briggs" title="6.3.1.1.&nbsp;Plume rise calculation">Section&nbsp;6.3.1.1, &#8220;Plume rise calculation&#8221;</a>, and provides the top and bottom heights of the plume. <span><strong class="command">Laypoint</strong></span> uses these heights to compute the plumes&#8217; distributions into the vertical layers that the plumes intersect, using the pressure
                  difference across each layer over the pressure difference across the entire plume as a weighting factor to make this calculation.
                  This approach gives plume fractions by layer and source. Only these fractions are stored in the output file (<code class="envar">PLAY</code>) from the <span><strong class="command">Laypoint</strong></span> program (not the emissions in each layer).
               </p>
               <p>If explicit plume rise sources (e.g., wildfires with precomputed hourly plume rise) are included in the inventory, <span><strong class="command">Laypoint</strong></span> will skip the plume rise calculation for these sources. Instead, it will use the hourly data from the SMOKE <code class="envar">PHOUR</code> intermediate file, which describe the fraction of emissions in layer 1 and the top and bottom of the plume. <span><strong class="command">Laypoint</strong></span> will combine these data with the pressure weights used for all elevated point sources to compute the fraction of emissions
                  to go into each layer.

If the <code class="envar">SMK_PING_METHOD</code> setting (discussed above) indicates that the special CMAQ PinG file should be created, the <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> program will also output this special file, called the <code class="envar">PINGTS_L</code> file.
