         <p>The second section of the <code class="envar">REPCONFIG</code> file is the Define-group section. This optional section is used for defining groups of source characteristics for use later
            in the Create-reports section. The Define-group section uses packets for defining groups. There are currently two types of
            groupings, and therefore two packet types for this section: regions and subgrids.

            <p>The /DEFINE SUBGRID/ packet is used for defining subdomains based on cell numbers from the full grid being applied using the

                     <p>Cell numbers should appear for all cells in the subgrid. The count (i.e. the x-cell count and the y-cell count) of the cells
                        depends on the grid defined by the gridding matrix being used by <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span>. A range can be given with the following syntax:
                     </p>
                     <p>(X cell, Y cell) TO (X cell, Y cell)</p>
                     <p>If only one cell is to be specified, the range must still appear, with both entries indicating the same cell.</p>
                     <p><span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> is not very sensitive to the spacing of this instruction, and additional spaces or no spaces may be placed between the parentheses,
                        the cell numbers, and the commas. Spaces around the &#8220;<span class="quote">TO</span>&#8221; are recommended.
                     </p>
                     <p>The maximum width of these lines is 100 characters. Multiple entries of this type may appear in the packet, allowing for the
                        grouping of spatially unconnected cells/regions or non-rectangular regions.

            <p>Group labels, denoted above by &lt;Label&gt;, are used to name a group for identification when creating a report in the Create-report
               section. The text appearing in the placeholder &lt;Label&gt; can be any alphanumeric combination of characters up to 200 characters,
               including intervening blanks. The text string (less trailing blanks) that occurs after /DEFINE .../ and before a comment (indicated
               with ##), is treated as the group label. References to the group label in the Create-report section do not have to be consistent
               in the case of the text; SMOKE will ignore the case of the text, treating lower- and uppercase characters as if they were
               the same.

            </div>
            <p>The INCLUDE and EXCLUDE instructions are used for defining the meaning of the entries in the packet. If the INCLUDE instruction
               appears, then <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> interprets the subsequent entries in the packet as identifying records to <span class="emphasis"><em>include</em></span> in the output report(s). On the other hand, if the EXCLUDE instruction appears, then <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> interprets the subsequent entries in the packet as identifying records to <span class="emphasis"><em>exclude</em></span> from the output report(s). The INCLUDE and EXCLUDE instructions may appear in both the /DEFINE GROUP REGION/ and /DEFINE
               SUBGRID/ packets. These instructions act as toggle switches, and <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> will give a warning if a county previously included is later excluded. All packet entries after an instruction will be interpreted
               according to the instruction, until another instruction is given, or until the packet ends. The INCLUDE instruction is the
               default, so if neither instruction is given, SMOKE will assume that the records in the packet are those to be only in the
               report.
            </p>
            <p>The ordering of INCLUDE or EXCLUDE instructions in a group definition can change the meaning of the group definition. If INCLUDE
               is given first, <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> will initialize the group to exclude all grid cells and then proceed with interpreting the instructions. On the other hand,
               if EXCLUDE is given first, <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> will initialize the group to include all grid cells. Here is an example for a small 6-cell by 6-cell grid, which shows how
               the order of the INCLUDE and EXCLUDE statements changes the meaning of a group definition.
            </p>
            <p>If the instructions are</p><pre class="programlisting">/DEFINE SUBGRID/ Example subgrid
    INCLUDE
      (2,2) TO (6,6)
    EXCLUDE 
      (3,3) TO (5,5)
    INCLUDE 
      (4,4) TO (4,4)
/END/</pre><p>then the following cells (shown in gray) will be selected:</p>

            </div>
            <p>If the instructions were rearranged to have the EXCLUDE statement first, then the initialized status for all cells would be
               INCLUDE. The additional INCLUDE statements are therefore unneeded, and the definition of the group changes to the following:
