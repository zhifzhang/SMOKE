         <p>Creating emissions with SMOKE that are ready for input to an AQM must always include merging the hourly emissions created
            during temporal processing with the gridding matrices and the speciation matrices. In addition, for point sources for CMAQ,
            creating the model-ready emissions must also include merging with the layer fractions (see <a href="ch02s15.html#sect_concepts_compute_layer_cmaq" title="2.15.1.&nbsp;Computing layer fractions for CMAQ">Section&nbsp;2.15.1, &#8220;Computing layer fractions for CMAQ&#8221;</a>), and for UAM-based models it must include creating the ASCII elevated file (see <a href="ch02s15s02.html" title="2.15.2.&nbsp;Creating an elevated-source file for UAM and CAMX">Section&nbsp;2.15.2, &#8220;Creating an elevated-source file for UAM and CAM<sub>X</sub>&#8221;</a>). The <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> program performs these processing steps using vector-matrix multiplication to combine the matrices and layer fractions with
            the hourly emissions vectors from the <span><strong class="command">Temporal</strong></span> program.
         </p>
         <p>If the overall SMOKE processing setup includes running the nonroad mobile category (or other source categories) as separate
            runs (see <a href="ch04.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;How to Use SMOKE">Chapter&nbsp;4, <i>How to Use SMOKE</i></a>, then <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> cannot be used to combine all source categories into a single output file. Instead, the <a href="ch06s08.html" title="6.8.&nbsp;Movesmrg"><span><strong class="command">Mrggrid</strong></span></a> program would combine the model-ready files from the individual source categories; for example, from separate SMOKE (including
            <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span>) runs for stationary area/nonpoint, nonroad mobile, windblown dust, wildfire, on-road mobile, and point sources. There is
            no limit to the number of model-ready files that <span><strong class="command">Mrggrid</strong></span> can combine into a single model-ready file, and the input files can be 2-D or 3-D.
         </p>
         <p><span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> can be run for any or all SMOKE source categories, but it can use only one of each SMOKE inventory type (area, biogenic,
            mobile, and point source) per run. You can run it to create model-ready files for only one SMOKE source category (area, biogenic,
            mobile, or point), or you can run it to create both the individual and combined model-ready files. The following list indicates
            the modes in which <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> can be run:
         </p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
               <li>
                  <p>Run for SMOKE area sources to create gridded, hourly, speciated emissions in moles/hour or moles/second. Can be used for all
                     area sources and/or nonroad mobile sources.
                  </p>

               <li>
                  <p>Run for SMOKE mobile sources to create gridded, hourly, speciated emissions in moles/hour or moles/ second.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Run for SMOKE point sources to create 3-D gridded, hourly, speciated emissions in moles/ second for CMAQ, <span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> run to create 2-D gridded, hourly, speciated emissions in moles/hour for UAM, or CAM<sub>X</sub> and an ASCII elevated-point-source file.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Run to convert the units and calculate state and county totals of biogenic emissions output by the <span><strong class="command">Tmpbio</strong></span> or <span><strong class="command">Tmpbeis3</strong></span> programs.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Run to perform any combination of the previously listed steps simultaneously and create a combined model-ready file that includes
                     multiple source categories. In this mode, only one each of SMOKE area, mobile, point, and biogenic sources can be included.
                     The same output units must be used for all source categories in a single run.
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>When creating model-ready emissions for any of the anthropogenic source categories, you may choose to apply one or more control
            matrices to the emissions to create controlled model-ready emissions. For each source category (area, mobile, or point), you
            can apply one multiplicative control matrix and one reactivity control matrix per run per source category. <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> is the only way you can apply the reactivity control matrix to the inventory, while the multiplicative control matrix can
            be applied by either <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> or the <span><strong class="command">Grwinven</strong></span> program.
         </p>
         <p>Many processing steps in SMOKE are independent of one another; for example, chemical speciation and temporal allocation can
            change without affecting one another. This independence means that when one step changes, another step does not need to be
            rerun in many cases. However, because <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> combines the data from all of these processing steps to create the model-ready emissions, if one of the earlier steps changes,
            then the merging step must also be rerun. This includes rerunning <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> to generate model-ready files, and if the <span><strong class="command">Mrggrid</strong></span> program was used, also rerunning that to merge data from multiple source categories together.
         </p>
         <p><span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> also has the ability to input hourly emissions by day of the week and reuse days that are the same. For example, it can input
            separate hourly emissions files for Monday, a weekday, Saturday, and Sunday, and use these four files to generate model-ready
            emissions for every day in an entire month. This is accomplished using the <code class="envar">MRG_BYDAY</code> SMOKE option, described further in <a href="ch06s14.html" title="6.14.&nbsp;Smkmerge">Section&nbsp;6.14, &#8220;<span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span>&#8221;</a>. Special treatment can also be given to holidays in this case, since users generally wish to model holidays differently than
            other days.
