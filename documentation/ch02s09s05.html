         <p>For point, nonpoint, on-road mobile, and nonroad-mobile sources, the toxics inventory contains emissions for VOC pollutants
            that are provided as explicit chemical compounds (for example, benzene). These same VOC emissions are also included as an
            aggregated VOC value in the criteria emissions inventory. To use these inventories together, <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> provides the necessary options to ensure that double counting of VOC emissions will not occur. These two options are the
            &#8220;<span class="quote">integrate</span>&#8221; and &#8220;<span class="quote">no-integrate</span>&#8221; options.
         </p>
         <p>The &#8220;<span class="quote">integrate</span>&#8221; option involves subtracting toxic VOC emissions from the criteria VOC emissions to avoid double counting of VOC when the
            emissions are speciated. With this option the user must ensure that the sources in the toxics and criteria inventories match
            up one-to-one, so that <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> can properly compute the emissions.
         </p>
         <p>Note that in any discussion of the toxics inventory we have assumed that all emissions are annual total emissions, because
            the toxics inventory that is currently available does not include average-day emissions. We have also assumed that the inventory
            contains VOC emissions, but the same approach can be used to process TOG emissions.
         </p>
         <p>During import of both toxics and criteria emission inventories, SMOKE matches the area/nonpoint, on-road mobile, and nonroad
            mobile emission inventories by country/state/county code and SCC. SMOKE also matches the toxics and criteria records for the
            point sources, provided that the point sources in the two inventories use identical fields for their source characteristics.
            You are required to ensure that the source characteristics for all source categories match between the two inventories for
            any sources that you wish to have matched. Once they are matched, SMOKE will have both a criteria VOC emissions value and
            toxics emission values for individual VOC chemical compounds.
         </p>
         <p>SMOKE can optionally compute a NONHAPVOC value by subtracting the sum of toxics VOC from the criteria VOC value. This same
            approach can be used to create a NONHAPTOG value if the inventory or MOVES (when processing on-road mobile emissions using
            VMT data) uses a TOG value instead of a VOC value. (We will not mention NONHAPTOG again, but it could be used to replace NONHAPVOC
            throughout this section).
         </p>
         <p>The case of computing NONHAPVOC is called the &#8220;<span class="quote">integrate</span>&#8221; case because it involves integration of the VOC mass between the criteria and toxics inventories. Likewise, the case of
            not computing NONHAPVOC is called the &#8220;<span class="quote">no-integrate</span>&#8221; case. With the &#8220;<span class="quote">integrate</span>&#8221; approach, the NONHAPVOC mass and the toxics VOC mass are independent from one another and will not double count emissions.
            The calculation must be performed for each source, and <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> will set the criteria VOC value to zero when it computes the NONHAPVOC value. <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> determines which pollutants should be subtracted from VOC using the &#8220;<span class="quote">VOC or TOG</span>&#8221; column in the inventory table (<code class="envar">INVTABLE</code>) file.
