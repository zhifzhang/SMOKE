         <p>When <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> reads an inventory, it also puts its sources into a special sorted order prior to outputting the SMOKE intermediate inventory
            files. All programs that read <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> outputs, which includes most of the SMOKE programs, expect this order. The order is determined by sorting the source characteristics
            listed in <a href="ch02s08.html#sect_concepts_summary_source_processing" title="2.8.1.&nbsp;Summary of SMOKE processing categories">Section&nbsp;2.8.1, &#8220;Summary of SMOKE processing categories&#8221;</a> in ascending order. For example, area sources will be sorted in order of increasing country/state/county code, and within
            a single country/state/county code will be sorted in order of increasing SCC. In <a href="ch02s09s06.html#fig_concepts_sort_inventory" title="Figure&nbsp;2.19.&nbsp;Combining and sorting ASCII inputs to created sorted I/O API outputs">Figure&nbsp;2.19, &#8220;Combining and sorting ASCII inputs to created sorted I/O API outputs&#8221;</a>, we show how the sorted order may be completely different from the order of the files and records provided to <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span>. The figure shows the unsorted ASCII input files at left (provided to <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> by logical files <code class="envar">ARINV</code>, <code class="envar">MBINV</code>, or <code class="envar">PTINV</code>) and how the records can be rearranged by <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> to create the sorted I/O API output files (output from <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> as <code class="envar">AREA</code>, <code class="envar">MOBL</code>, or <code class="envar">PNTS</code>). Each record in this diagram represents a complete inventory record with all source characteristics, source attributes,
            and emissions.
         </p>
         <div class="figure"><a name="fig_concepts_sort_inventory"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.19.&nbsp;Combining and sorting ASCII inputs to created sorted I/O API outputs</b></p>

         </div>
         <p>Having this sorted order is important because the programs that depend on <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> outputs also store their outputs in the same order. However, these other programs (such as <span><strong class="command">Temporal</strong></span> for temporal allocation, <span><strong class="command">Spcmat</strong></span> for chemical speciation, and <span><strong class="command">Grdmat</strong></span> for spatial allocation) store their records using the record numbers to match their outputs with the <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> outputs. This means that the source characteristics that are stored in the <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> outputs are not also included in the outputs from <span><strong class="command">Temporal</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">Spcmat</strong></span>, <span><strong class="command">Grdmat</strong></span> and other programs; these programs rely on the sorted order in the <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> outputs not changing. This approach allows minimal redundant data storage, this reducing disk space needs.
         </p>
         <p>As explained previously, the records output from <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> are vectors of emissions and source characteristics that make up the SMOKE intermediate inventory files. Each record number
            in the file identifies an element of the vector. The outputs from <span><strong class="command">Temporal</strong></span> are also vectors of hourly emissions. The record number in each hourly vector will match the record number in the intermediate
            inventory files. The outputs from <span><strong class="command">Spcmat</strong></span> are a matrix of speciation factors, in which the record numbers (rows of the matrix) will match the record numbers of the
            intermediate inventory files. The columns of the matrix are each valid pollutant-to-species transformations. The outputs from
            <span><strong class="command">Grdmat</strong></span> are a sparse matrix, but again the rows of the matrix match the rows of the intermediate inventory file.  Therefore, assignment
            of factors is a simple matter of selecting the same record number from the <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> output files; this is in fact one part of the vector-matrix multiplication used by SMOKE.
         </p>
         <p>It is important to remember this sorted-order approach when you have run an inventory through all of the programs once, and
            then want to change your inventory and re-import the data with <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span>. For the re-importing and subsequent rerun, if any source characteristics in the inventory change, or if any sources are
            added or removed, then the number and/or order of the output sources in the new <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> outputs will be different. This means that the outputs from all processing steps that depend on the <span><strong class="command">Smkinven</strong></span> outputs will need to be rerun.
