         <p>SMOKE supports a variety of inventory formats for criteria, particulate, toxics, and activity data inventories, which are
            described in detail in <a href="ch08s02.html" title="8.2.&nbsp;Inventory Files">Section&nbsp;8.2, &#8220;Inventory Files&#8221;</a>. Here, we provide a brief introduction to these formats, which will be helpful as you read more about SMOKE in the remainder
            of this chapter and the chapters before <a href="ch08.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;SMOKE Input Files">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i>SMOKE Input Files</i></a>. All formats described here are text files. To convert your data to these formats, the best approach is to use a database
            or spreadsheet program to reformat and output the data in the requested format. There is not a standard format-conversion
            method that comes with SMOKE.
         </p>
         <p> In the following paragraphs, we describe the formats available for nonpoint/stationary area, nonroad mobile, on-road mobile,
            point, and point-wildfire sources.

               <li>
                  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Nonpoint/stationary area sources:</strong></span> SMOKE supports two formats for nonpoint/stationary area sources.  The ORL and FF10 (Flat File 10) format are list directed
                     (comma or semicolon delimited) and these file formats may be used to represent many different sources. The header of the file
                     indicates what source data are in the file.
                  </p>

               <li>
                  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Nonroad mobile sources:</strong></span> There are three available inventory formats for nonroad mobile sources.  The FF10 (Flat File 10) format is list directed
                     (comma or semicolon delimeted) and the header of the file is used to indicate the nonroad mobile source data is within the
                     file.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p><span class="bold"><strong>On-road mobile sources:</strong></span> The Flat File 10 (FF10) format is list directed (comma or semicolon delimited) and contains activity inventory such as VMT,
                     speed, and vehicle population data.  This format requires VMT, SPEED, and VPOP inventory data.
                  </p>

               <li>
                  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Point sources:</strong></span> SMOKE has formats for annual or average-day inventories, for day-specific inventories, and for hour-specific inventories.
                     For annual or average-day inventories, the ORL and FF10 formats can be used for criteria, particulate, and toxics inventories.
                     Finally, the CEM data format can be used for day-specific or hour-specific data : SMOKE uses the ORIS codes and boiler codes
                     in the annual inventory files to match sources from the CEM data files.

               <li>
                  <p><span class="bold"><strong>Wildfire sources:</strong></span> There are two approches available that you can provide wildfire data that are being treated as point sources to SMOKE using
                     the ORL and FF10 point-source formats.
                  </p>

                        <li><span class="bold"><strong>Precomputed plume rise approach:</strong></span> Certain fields must be left blank (such as stack parameters) because they do not apply to wildfire sources. When using wildfire
                           data provided as point sources, you must also provide day-specific or hour-specific wildfire emissions and hour-specific precomputed
                           plume rise using the FF10 day-specific and hour-specific formats.
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="bold"><strong>Internal plume rise calculation approach:</strong></span> Requires two separate inventory files that are provided in a modified ORL format: (1) a list of fires with fire-specific
                           characteristics including county/state/county, fire identification, location coordinate, fire name, SCC and others, as described
                           in <a href="ch08s02s08.html#sect_input_ptinv_fire" title="8.2.8.3.&nbsp;ORL FIRE Format">Section&nbsp;8.2.8.3, &#8220;ORL FIRE Format&#8221;</a>, and (2) a day-specific fire data including size of area burned, fuel loading, and star/end hour of fire (<a href="ch08s02s06.html#sect_input_ptday_fireemis" title="8.2.6.2.&nbsp;ORL FIREEMIS Emission Format">Section&nbsp;8.2.6.2, &#8220;ORL FIREEMIS Emission Format&#8221;</a>). Unlike the approach listed above, this approach internally estimates the plume rise using the size of the area burned and
                           fuel loading, and it adjusts temporal profiles using the start and end hours of the fire. See detail at <a href="ch04s04s17.html" title="4.4.17.&nbsp;Plume Rise Calculation for Fires">Section&nbsp;4.4.17, &#8220;Plume Rise Calculation for Fires&#8221;</a></li>
