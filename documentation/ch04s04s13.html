         <p>Changing the temporal aspect of SMOKE processing is one of the critical changes that users must make. One of the most basic
            changes that you can make to SMOKE is the time period for which SMOKE will be run. In this section, we will explain how to
            make the following changes to your SMOKE processing:

                     <p>SMOKE provides the capability for optionally assigning different diurnal profiles for different days of the week. The file
                        format for the <code class="envar">ATPRO</code>, <code class="envar">MTPRO</code>, and <code class="envar">PTPRO</code> file explains the different sections of the file that you can use to assign these different profiles. Before you add temporal
                        profiles, you must decide which approach you will use for the new profiles:
                     </p>
                     <div class="itemizedlist">
                        <ul type="disc">

                              <p>Different diurnal profiles for weekdays and weekends (using the /DIURNAL WEEKDAY/ and /DIURNAL WEEKEND/ packets).</p>

                              <p>Different diurnal profiles for each day of the week (using the /DIURNAL &lt;DAYNAME&gt;/ packets, where &lt;DAYNAME&gt; = the day of the

                  <li>
                     <p>Ensure that different diurnal profiles for different days of the week will match across the days.</p>
                     <p>When setting up new diurnal temporal profiles, it is important is ensure that the same temporal profile codes are used across
                        the packets for the diurnal profiles because as source can only be assigned a single code for all of its diurnal profiles.
                        For example, if a source were to use diurnal profile code 50, that code must be included in all of the diurnal packets and
                        all instances of code 50 must be for that source. In other words, it is not possible to assign code 50 on Mondays and code
                        60 on Tuesdays.

                     </p>
                     <p>The file format for the <code class="envar">ATPRO</code>, <code class="envar">MTPRO</code>, and <code class="envar">PTPRO</code> files is in <a href="ch08.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;SMOKE Input Files">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i>SMOKE Input Files</i></a>. To add new diurnal profiles, you must edit these files in a text editor and the new profiles added. It is possible to use
                        the same file instead of three separate files; in this case, just configure the Assigns file to use the same file name for
                        all three logical file names. This has been done in the default configuration.

                     </p>
                     <p>The file format for the <code class="envar">ATREF</code>, <code class="envar">MTREF</code>, and <code class="envar">PTREF</code> files is in <a href="ch08.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;SMOKE Input Files">Chapter&nbsp;8, <i>SMOKE Input Files</i></a>. To add or change temporal profile assignments, you must edit these files in a text editor and select the source characteristics
                        that will be associated with a diurnal, weekly, and monthly profile. The example file uses primarily SCCs to assign temporal
                        profiles, but the file format supports other fields to make more specific assignments by county, pollutant, link ID, plant
                        ID, or other point-source characteristics.

                  <li>
                     <p>Ensure <code class="envar">ATREF</code>, <code class="envar">MTREF</code>, and <code class="envar">PTREF</code> have entries for all sources in the inventory.
                     </p>
                     <p>Once you have edited the file, you will need to check that all sources are being assigned profiles or that the default temporal
                        profile is acceptable for sources that do not have more specific assignments. The easiest way to check that the files are
                        acceptable to you is to run it through the <span><strong class="command">Temporal</strong></span> program using the <code class="envar">REPORT_DEFAULTS</code> option set to Y. With this option, the <span><strong class="command">Temporal</strong></span> log file will report all sources that have received the default temporal profile. You can review the log file to determine
                        if this default is acceptable to you. Additionally, you can run <span><strong class="command">Smkreport</strong></span> (after <span><strong class="command">Temporal</strong></span> has been run) with the following instructions in the <code class="envar">REPCONFIG</code> input file to get a report with the temporal profile codes that <span><strong class="command">Temporal</strong></span> assigned to each source.

To change the run length, the following steps must be taken.

                     <p>The <code class="envar">G_STDATE</code> setting in the Assigns file is the starting date of the first SMOKE model-ready emissions file. The <code class="envar">G_STDATE_ADVANCE</code> script variable is set in the scripts so that the scripts will automatically reset the <code class="envar">G_STDATE</code> variable as need to run SMOKE for each period in the episode. The length of those periods is set by the <code class="envar">G_RUNLEN</code> variable and the number of periods is <code class="envar">EPI_RUNLEN</code> divided by <code class="envar">G_RUNLEN</code>.

                  <li>
                     <p>Set the <code class="envar">G_STTIME</code> setting the same as the EPI_STTIME. This value is the start time that you wish to use for each model-ready emissions file
                        created in your SMOKE run. This value is usually 0.
                     </p>
                     <p>Generally, the start time must also be consistent with the start time of the other inputs to the air quality model, such as
                        the meteorology data. For example, if the meteorology data start at 12 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and the air quality model
                        will also start at that time, then the emissions files will also need to start at 12 GMT. This can be achieved by setting
                        <code class="envar">G_STTIME</code> and <code class="envar">EPI_STTIME</code> to 120000 (HHMMSS format).

                     <p>Set the <code class="envar">G_TSTEP</code> setting to 10000 for 1 hour (HHMMSS format). In version 2 of SMOKE and earlier, this is the only setting that is supported
                        by the code.

                     </p>
                     <p>The run length can be set to as many hours as your air quality model can support for a single input file, as long as your
                        files do not surpass a 2 GB file size limit, which are be imposed by 32-bit UNIX operating systems and by the NetCDF library
                        on which SMOKE is based. Generally, the air quality models can accept files for as long as the user wishes to provide, so
                        the limit is therefore the file sizes, which can be determined by trial and error. The conservative approach is to create
                        emissions files for 1 day at a time.
                     </p>
                     <p>The air quality models require an extra hour of emissions data for each file. Therefore the number of hours for the <code class="envar">G_RUNLEN</code> setting is computed as:
                     </p>
                     <p>(number of days per file) x 24 + 1</p>
                     <p>The <code class="envar">G_RUNLEN</code> setting must be in format of HHHHMMSS where HHHH is a four-digit number of hours, MM is the minutes (must be 00), and SS
                        is the seconds (must also be 00).

                     </p>
                     <p>Recall that the <code class="envar">ESDATE</code> setting is for naming files. In the Assigns file, the value of this setting should be the starting date for the first emissions
                        file to be created by the SMOKE run. The default SMOKE script configuration will automatically update <code class="envar">ESDATE</code> for subsequent run periods.

            <p>As previously explain in <a href="ch02s10s05.html" title="2.10.5.&nbsp;Holiday processing">Section&nbsp;2.10.5, &#8220;Holiday processing&#8221;</a>, SMOKE can model holidays as special days. The holidays that are relevant are those holidays for which anthropogenic activities
               are significantly altered, since its those activities that determine the appropriate weight to give the emissions on each
               day of the week and the diurnal temporal patterns for those days. For example, the nearly all workers in the U.S. have a holiday
               from their employment on Thanksgiving day, and the patterns of industrial and motor-vehicle activities are substantially altered
               resulting in different emissions patterns on those days. The Valentines Day holiday, however, does not affect such patterns
               because employers do not allow workers a day off on that day.
            </p>
            <p>The <code class="envar">HOLIDAYS</code> file controls which days SMOKE will treat as holidays and which day of the week SMOKE will emulate for that day. The file
               must be created for each year, since some holiday dates are different each year. Although the format of the file suggests
               that the holidays can be modeled differently for different counties in the inventory, this is not the case - the format is
               provided for a future update to SMOKE, which has not yet been implemented.
            </p>
            <p>To change the holiday dates that are modeled by SMOKE, all that is required is changing the <code class="envar">HOLIDAYS</code> file to include the year and holidays in which you are interested, and select a day of the week to use for modeling that
               holiday. If you do not wish SMOKE to treat a holiday any differently, then it should be removed from the file. If you wish
               no days to be modeled as holidays, we recommend including at least one date in the file, and assigning its actual day of the
               week, to prevent SMOKE from getting confused.

            </div>
            <p>SMOKE includes a little-used option to allow SMOKE to ignore all temporal profile information from the temporal cross-reference
               and temporal profiles. In this case, the emissions will be constant for all hours of all days, except for a slight variation
               from month to month to account for the different number of days in each month. This option still requires the temporal cross-reference
               and temporal profile input files, but they are ignored. To use this capability in SMOKE, set the <code class="envar">UNIFORM_TPROF_YN</code> setting in the run script to Y.
