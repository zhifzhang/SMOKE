         <p>The temporal variation of the days in a week is the same from week to week within a month because SMOKE uses weekly profiles.
            Also, it is common that the weekly profiles do not vary on Monday through Friday. Consequently, it is often desirable for
            long (e.g., annual) simulations to use a Monday-weekday-Saturday-Sunday (MWSS) approach. With this approach, SMOKE computes
            emissions for a representative Monday, weekday, Saturday, and Sunday within each month. The representative days cannot be
            the first day of the month (to prevent effects from the previous month from being included in the emissions data), a holiday
            (as set in the <code class="envar">HOLIDAYS</code> file), or the day after the holiday. Monday is distinguished from other weekdays because in multi-time zone cases in the
            Western Hemisphere with <code class="envar">OUTZONE</code> set to 0 (i.e. GMT), a few late-night Sunday hours are included in the hours at the start of the Monday file. In addition,
            one must specifically process the holidays and the day after holidays as separate runs for all holidays set by the <code class="envar">HOLIDAYS</code> file. During merging of emissions, the Monday, weekday, Saturday, and Sunday files are reused to create model-ready emissions
            for every day and hour needed. The holiday and day-after files are used for the holiday and day-after dates only.
         </p>
         <p>This approach relies heavily on scripting to select dates for each month&#8217;s representative days and to ensure that the days
            that are run are consistent with the dates in the <code class="envar">HOLIDAYS</code> file. Scripting is also responsible for ensuring that the correct files are merged together by <span><strong class="command">Smkmerge</strong></span> to create the model-ready files for all days of the episode. These scripting issues are described in more detail in <a href="ch04.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;How to Use SMOKE">Chapter&nbsp;4, <i>How to Use SMOKE</i></a>.
         </p>
         <p>There are some situations in which you cannot use the MWSS approach. In particular, on-road processing with MOVES must be
            run for all days of the episode, although some steps can be sped up by using the meteorology averaging approach. Additionally,
            biogenic emissions processing obtains all of its temporal variation from the meteorology data, and therefore must be run for
            all days. Fortunately, biogenic emissions processing is very fast compared to processing for other source categories.
