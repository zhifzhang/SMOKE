         <p>The paradigm for atmospheric emissions models prior to SMOKE was a network of pipes and filters. This means that at any given
            stage in the processing, an emissions file includes self-contained records describing each source and <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of the attributes acquired from previous processing stages. Each processing stage acts as a filter that inputs a stream of
            these fully-defined records, combines it with data from one or more support files, and produces a new stream of these records.
            Redundant data are passed down the pipe at the cost of extra I/O, storage, data processing, and program complexity. Using
            this method, all processing is performed one record at a time, without necessarily a structure or order to the records.
         </p>
         <p>This old paradigm came about as a way to avoid repeatedly searching through data files for needed information, which would
            be very inefficient. It is admirably suited to older computer architectures with very small available memories and tape-only
            storage, but is not suitable for current desktop machines or high-performance computers. SMOKE developers demonstrated this
            when the Emissions Preprocessor System (EPS) 2.0 was run on a Cray Y-MP. It ran four times slower on the Cray machine (a much
            faster computer) than on a desktop 150 MHz DEC Alphastation 3000/300. This paradigm also fostered a serial approach to the
            emissions processing steps, as shown in <a href="ch02s07.html#fig_concepts_serial_approach" title="Figure&nbsp;2.3.&nbsp;Serial approach to emissions processing">Figure&nbsp;2.3, &#8220;Serial approach to emissions processing&#8221;</a>.

         </div>
         <p>The new paradigm implemented in SMOKE came about from analyses indicating that emissions computations should be quite adaptable
            to high-performance computing if the paradigm were appropriately changed. For each SMOKE processing category (i.e., area,
            biogenic, mobile, and point sources), the following tasks are performed:
         </p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
               <li>
                  <p>read emissions inventory data files</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>optionally grow emissions from the base year to the (future or past) modeled year (except biogenic sources)</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>transform inventory species into chemical mechanism species defined by an AQM</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>optionally apply emissions controls (except for biogenic sources)</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>model the temporal distribution of the emissions, including any meteorology effects</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>model the spatial distribution of the emissions;</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>merge the various source categories of emissions to form input files for the AQM</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>at every step of the processing, perform quality assurance on the input data and the results</p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>Each processing category has its particular complexities and deviations from the above list; these are described in <a href="ch02s08.html" title="2.8.&nbsp;Area, biogenic, mobile, and point processing summaries">Section&nbsp;2.8, &#8220;Area, biogenic, mobile, and point processing summaries&#8221;</a>. For all categories, however, most of the needed processing steps are <span class="emphasis"><em>factor-based</em></span>; they are linear operations that can be represented as multiplication by matrices. Further, some of the matrices are <span class="emphasis"><em>sparse</em></span> matrices (i.e., most of their entries are zeros).
         </p>
         <p>SMOKE is designed to take advantage of these facts by formulating emissions modeling in terms of sparse matrix operations,
            which can be performed by optimized sparse matrix libraries. Specifically, the inventory emissions are arranged as a vector
            of emissions sorted in a particular order, with associated vectors that include characteristics about the sources such as
            the state/county and SCCs. SMOKE then creates matrices that apply the control, gridding, and speciation factors to the vector
            of emissions. In many cases, these matrices are independent from one another, and can therefore be generated in parallel and
            applied to the inventory in a final &#8220;<span class="quote">merge</span>&#8221; step, which combines the inventory emissions vector (now an hourly inventory file) with the control, speciation, and gridding
            matrices to create model-ready emissions. <a href="ch02s07.html#fig_concepts_parallel_approach" title="Figure&nbsp;2.4.&nbsp;Parallel approach to emissions processing">Figure&nbsp;2.4, &#8220;Parallel approach to emissions processing&#8221;</a> shows how the matrix approach allows for a more parallel approach to emissions processing, in which fewer steps depend on
            other needed steps.
         </p>
         <p>Note that in <a href="ch02s07.html#fig_concepts_parallel_approach" title="Figure&nbsp;2.4.&nbsp;Parallel approach to emissions processing">Figure&nbsp;2.4, &#8220;Parallel approach to emissions processing&#8221;</a>, temporal allocation outputs hourly emissions instead of a temporal matrix. This is because of some peculiarities with temporal
            modeling for point sources, which can use hourly emissions as input data. To be able to overwrite the inventory emissions
            with these hourly emissions, the temporal allocation step must output the emissions data. The matrix approach is used internally
            in the temporal allocation step.
         </p>
         <p>The growth and controls steps shown in <a href="ch02s07.html#fig_concepts_parallel_approach" title="Figure&nbsp;2.4.&nbsp;Parallel approach to emissions processing">Figure&nbsp;2.4, &#8220;Parallel approach to emissions processing&#8221;</a> are optional. If the inventory is not grown to a future or past year, then the temporal allocation step uses the original
            inventory vectors to calculate the hourly emissions.
         </p>
         <div class="figure"><a name="fig_concepts_parallel_approach"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.4.&nbsp;Parallel approach to emissions processing</b></p>
            <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images\concepts\parallel_approach_html.jpg" alt="Parallel approach to emissions processing"></div>
         </div>
         <p>Several benefits can be realized from this more parallel approach. For example, given a single emissions inventory, temporal
            modeling is performed only once per inventory and episode (though in practice, this step is often performed once per episode
            day). Also, gridding matrices typically need only be calculated once per inventory and model grid definition, without having
            to reprocess other steps. As shown in <a href="ch02s07.html#fig_concepts_additional_grid" title="Figure&nbsp;2.5.&nbsp;Processing steps for running an additional grid in SMOKE">Figure&nbsp;2.5, &#8220;Processing steps for running an additional grid in SMOKE&#8221;</a>, SMOKE usually needs to rerun only the gridding and merge steps to process a different grid for the same inventory. The merge
            step in the figure will read the previously created results from the temporal allocation, chemical speciation, and control
            processing steps.
         </p>
         <div class="figure"><a name="fig_concepts_additional_grid"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.5.&nbsp;Processing steps for running an additional grid in SMOKE</b></p>
            <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images\concepts\additional_grid_html.jpg" alt="Processing steps for running an additional grid in SMOKE"></div>
         </div>
         <p>In addition, speciation matrices need only be calculated once per inventory and chemical mechanism. Similar to the gridding
            example, <a href="ch02s07.html#fig_concepts_additional_chemical" title="Figure&nbsp;2.6.&nbsp;Processing steps for running an additional chemical mechanism in SMOKE">Figure&nbsp;2.6, &#8220;Processing steps for running an additional chemical mechanism in SMOKE&#8221;</a> shows the SMOKE steps that generally need to be rerun for running an additional chemical mechanism.
         </p>
         <div class="figure"><a name="fig_concepts_additional_chemical"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.6.&nbsp;Processing steps for running an additional chemical mechanism in SMOKE</b></p>
            <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images\concepts\additional_chemical_html.jpg" alt="Processing steps for running an additional chemical mechanism in SMOKE"></div>
         </div>
         <p>A final example of how this approach is beneficial is processing with a control strategy. Because of SMOKE&#8217;s parallel processing,
            changing a control strategy requires only the control and merge steps to be processed again (<a href="ch02s07.html#fig_concepts_running_control" title="Figure&nbsp;2.7.&nbsp;Processing steps for running a control scenario in SMOKE">Figure&nbsp;2.7, &#8220;Processing steps for running a control scenario in SMOKE&#8221;</a>). In serial processing, on the other hand, the growth and controls step occurs as the second processing step, which requires
            that all downstream steps be redone. In <a href="ch02s07.html#fig_concepts_running_control" title="Figure&nbsp;2.7.&nbsp;Processing steps for running a control scenario in SMOKE">Figure&nbsp;2.7, &#8220;Processing steps for running a control scenario in SMOKE&#8221;</a>, the speciation, temporal allocation, and gridding steps have already been run, and can be fed to the merge step without
            being altered or regenerated.
         </p>

         <p>Although SMOKE processing generally follows the structure shown in <a href="ch02s07.html#fig_concepts_parallel_approach" title="Figure&nbsp;2.4.&nbsp;Parallel approach to emissions processing">Figure&nbsp;2.4, &#8220;Parallel approach to emissions processing&#8221;</a>, there are some exceptions.

                  <p><span class="bold"><strong>On-road mobile processing with MOVES:</strong></span> One way of processing on-road mobile-source emissions is to have SMOKE run the MOVES model based on hourly, gridded meteorology

                     steps that we have not yet discussed. These differences from the standard processing approach are described in <a href="ch02s08s04.html" title="2.8.4.&nbsp;Mobile-source processing using MOVES">Section&nbsp;2.8.4, &#8220;Mobile-source processing using MOVES&#8221;</a>.
